I really had high hopes for this wireless device. Most of my pro-gamers I watch stream promote the A40 so I figured I'd give these wireless versions a shot. My first Astro Gaming product. I game on PC, xbox & Playstation so this model seemed like the most versatile version.

1st shipment from amazon came quick and setup was somewhat of a breeze. there is noticeable delay and lag when the receiver turns off to when the headset recognizes it. also when you unplug the charging for the headset there is great delay before the status light recognizes this. that's really no biggie but annoying when dealing with a wireless device with no cues other than that status light.

Either way, 4 days later I have absolutely NO sound when connecting on one of my consoles. I troubleshot for some time. connecting, disconnecting, messing with the volume, with the console settings, with the side earpiece volume setting. NOTHING. Finally after close to an hour i realized that the side earpiece area that allows you to lower the volume of voice or increase the volume of game is not working as expected. setting the earpiece to more game volume was actually MUTING the sound and the reverse was true. that function had reversed

Contacted support and after a few days they admit this is not normal and have no clue how to fix. Returned to Amazon (with no problems of course. Thank you amazon!)

2nd shipment got here yesterday from Amazon and again setup and updated firmware with no problems. When all of a sudden SOUND is lost, this time on my 2nd console. Tried on my other console SAME THING! But this time it has nothing to do with the sir earpiece voice/game volume. Now the red light stays solid on the headset. Even after you've turned off the receiver. I've even disconnected the receiver and held down the power button on the headset for 10, 15 minutes but NOTHING would turn it off. It's behaving like it has a hard error. I had to let the battery die down before charging it up and trying again. Happened AGAIN today. I'm typing this starring at a solid red light on the headset. A NON functional headset that is. I tried connecting it to my PC to see if I could re-firmware it and hard reset it but the PC can't recognize it. As long as a solid red light is on it will do absolutely nothing like it's in a hard error state.

I contact support but just realized now; do I really have to go through this on a $300 product that is NEW??? I don't think so.

I am not very happy with Ubisoft or 1C or for that matter Oleg. I have all the available Flight Sim from the Sturmovik series, and the other Sims such as Lock on from 1c too, as well as many other sims from the series and company..
Cliffs of Dover is an example of a sim gone bad, no actually a sim started bad and for what I can tell never improved, and to add insult having to use steam as the primary security enitiy to prevent hacked games. While steam has it's good points such as Automatic updating, good security, seamless online play, fast download speeds and from my area short ping times.
I downloaded new MOD from A.T.A.C.  (very good site and great people here). But this did not solve many of the existing problems.

1.0,True,"02 10, 2014",A3GJ2YTWXKO3K5,B007FMSH4M,Jeff,"Look, I've played some mediocre games in my day. And if a game has some redeeming qualities, I'm not above hacking my way through the unpolished parts to get to them. Two Worlds II, for example, was a little rough around the edges. But I enjoyed it nonetheless, and spent upwards of 40 hours fighting my way through to the end.

Risen 2 takes the term ""unpolished"" to a whole new level. To the point where I'm only an hour in, and I'm ready to throw in the towel. Let me count the ways that this game is absolutely atrocious (so far)...

1) The title screen for this game -- which, as near as I can determine, is set sometime around the 1600s -- features an image of a foreboding skull, along with a spinning CD (with a message about autosaving). Excellent art direction so far, fellas. You couldn't have changed that CD icon to something more period-appropriate? A treasure chest perhaps?

2) All of the text in this game -- from the intro sequence to the character names to every bit of text in the menu -- is all in caps for no reason whatsoever. And it's italicized. And I'm pretty sure it's Times New Roman. It's almost as if no one who developed this game knows anything about design, because it's an eyesore.

3) Despite being set in a tropical pirate setting, the graphics are dull and muddy.

4) The voice acting is awful, as though the seemingly-disinterested actors were thinking to themselves the entire time, ""I'm getting paid in cash for this, right?""

5) While locked in a tense duel with some sand crabs or something at the start of the game, the camera inexplicably rotated 180 degrees, so that all I could see was the main character, flailing wildly with his sword. The creatures I was supposed to be fighting were located somewhere out of the frame.

6) The cutscenes not only feature choppy graphics that look like they're from 2002, but also textures that appear and disappear randomly, clunky dialogue and a general sense that whoever ""directed"" these scenes has never actually interacted with another human.

7) I have no idea where I'm supposed to be going, because the map is utterly useless. I managed to figure out how to get out of the outpost by simply talking to everyone, but now that I've hopped a ship and ended up in some other town, I foresee being completely lost at all times.

In my short time with Risen 2, I can confidently say that it's the worst PS3 game I've ever played. I know that making games is not an easy task, but this is just an unfinished mess of a game that never should've been released. Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I'll continue chipping away at it for a bit, just to see if there are any redeeming qualities, and I'll update this review accordingly if this game grows on me at all. But for the time being, this is just an absolute trainwreck.","Good god, this game sucks",1391990400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Instead of eliminating lines, as done in the classic Tetris, assembling a 3 by 2 grouping of 6 blocks will create a solid stone. After completing a predetermined amount of your ""Fortress"",  you will be given a catapult piece. This piece will be used to attack your opponent's fortress.
At first, the game appeared to be a Tetris clone. I started stacking blocks between two flag poles. This seemed rather easy to me until the flag poles started to move, then it got a little frustrating. After blocks started fusing together, I started to get the general idea. The enemy began firing at my fused blocks within the first minute of play. I realized at this point I probably should have read the manual before playing.
The second time playing Fortress,  the point behind the game still eluded me.  Granted, I was now stacking blocks like a pro,  but this time, the bombardment still continued as scheduled.  No matter what I do, the game will not allow you to build a castle and completely defend it. I equate this game to building a sandcastle on the beach. Lets say you build it in the tide. Every time a wave comes along, it destroys a part of what you made, so therefore, you can never complete your castle. You keep doing this until frustration sets in and you quit all together.

I know that the 3D Sonic games tend to have a polarizing reputation, but in all honesty, I liked most of his 3D outings, with the only two exceptions being the SD version of Unleashed, which wasn't bad by any means, but I preferred the HD version (which I am going to discuss later on), and THIS!  Okay, so the gist is that Sega had to rush the game into stores in order to meet the 15th anniversary deadline so they could remain financially stable, and it really shows.  One the one hand, I do admire how it tries to recapture the ambition of the Adventure duology & Shadow the Hedgehog, but when it misses, it really misses.  First, let's look at the story.  Sonic decided to go on a vacation in Soleanna, the City of Water, where they are celebrating the Festival of the Sun.  Just as when its princess, Elise, lit the giant torch in the center of the city, Dr. Eggman with a new and pretty odd appearance, arrives and captures Elise to seek the Flames of Disaster, despite Sonic's best efforts to save her, but she gives him the blue Chaos Emerald.  So, Sonic teams up with Tails and Knuckles to rescue Elise, investigate the mystery of the Flames of Disaster Eggman mentioned, rinse and repeat about six times, and there you have Sonic's story.  Shadow's story is that he and Omega broke into Eggman's base to rescue Rouge and retrieve the Scepter of Darkness.  However, at the rondevux point, Eggman knocks the scepter out of Rouge's hands and causes it to shatter, freeing an entity known as Mephiles who took on Shadow's appearance as he was the one who sealed him inside ten years before using time travel.  There is also the newcomer, Silver, who came from a future devastated by Iblis and enlisted the help of Blaze from Sonic Rush, who possibly warped there and lost her memory for some reason.  Since Iblis keeps healing despite their best efforts to take it down, they run into Mephiles who uses Chaos Control for them to travel back in time in order to kill Sonic, who Mephiles prophecised to be the so-called ""Iblis Trigger"", and it becomes one big, convoluted, contradictory, stupid, melodramatic, & plot hole-laced adventure with a revolting love story between Sonic & Elise for good measure.  Wrap your head around that.  In addition to the 4kids voice cast, there was also Lost in Space survivor Lacey Chabert as the voice of Elise, who also made a guest appearance in the Black Christmas remake the exact same year.  To be fair, Chabert's voice in general can be annoying at times, but she at least tries acting-wise.  She, along with Mike Pollock as Eggman & Dan Green as Mephiles, were the three best voice actors in this game.  Everyone else's talents were wasted by the material they had to work with.  As far as the gameplay is concerned, I do admire how it tries to recapture what made Adventure 1 & 2's gameplay so special to me and try not to make the same mistake Heroes made in having the playable characters, stages, and bosses virtually the same; and the music is pretty cool.  However, it was bogged down by some fatal flaws.

1. It suffers from the exact same problem as Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly which I reviewed two years ago.  A lot of the glitches can be game-breaking and they have become the butt of a joke on Youtube, right down to Knuckles & Rouge getting stuck to the wall on occasion, characters running off loop-de-loops and falling to their deaths, etc.

2. What is up with the excessive load screens?  One way I can sum them up is talk to somebody, load screen, they tell you the objective, load screen, you do the mission, load screen, they congratulate you on a job well done, results, ANOTHER LOAD SCREEN!  Trust me.  Extensive loading can leave some people bored out of their minds, especially when you take into account of how tedious the side missions can be for some reason.

3.  Some of the character bosses can be pretty cheap, such as Silver when he constantly throws you at nearby walls using telekinesis without giving you any time to react while shouting ""It's no use"" over and over again.  The same can go for the opposite side of the spectrum when you play as Silver and you can just throw items and debris at Sonic & Shadow, and you win, kind of like in the horrible Karate Kid 3 when Daniel threw one punch at Mike Barnes and he won the fight.  At least the character battles in Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 were fair.  To be fair, the remaining bosses at least had more emphasis on strategy than the ""attack repeatedly"" no-brainer ones from Heroes, but still could have used some extra work.

4. Despite being able to roam around freely and it is not on-rails, the controls were mind-blowingly awful.  It doesn't look bad when you watch gameplay videos, but trust me, it's bad.  A lot of the characters' maneuvering felt way more slippery, clunky, and sensitive than other 3D Sonic games combined and the attacks felt so awkward and stiff that I usually get hit first.  It is hard to do controls justice and that, along with the ""where the *@&+ do I go"" level design, cheap obstacles, etc., is what killed the game for me, so the true way to know is to play it yourself, and to quote Chris McCleen from Total Drama Island, I triple dog dare you.

There are more reasons why this game became the Sonic series' crowning achievement of failure, but this review was getting long as is.

Actually, I've never really had a keyboard fail at typing before, period...in fact, I'm currently typing this edit to this review on an old dell keyboard from 2001...lol.

Original Review:

A solid mechanical keyboard. Keys are plastic, but it's nice to have the aluminum base. Makes it feel a little classier.

Doesn't use any software. All the programming is done via the keys on the board itself. I think that confuses people, as it's unusual to not use software for that type of thing, but it's important to point out, so people don't think there's something wrong with the board.

I don't really care about programming the lighting. I don't look at my keyboard while gaming, so lighting up specific keys seems pointless, but it doesn't hurt, I suppose.

It comes with additional ""game-friendly"" keycaps for WASD and 1-6. I only use the ""W"" one. ""A"" and ""D"" especially, due to their contouring, are horrible for actual typing, and who's got the time to be switching back and forth. Even the ""W"" one does little, probably, but it also doesn't interfere with my typing, so I use it. Plus, it looks great:) That said, I would LOVE to see all the keys have the same texture as those extra contoured keycaps had. That, to me, is the best thing about them, and an entire keyboard with textured keys would be AMAZING.

If you don't know how to take the caps off, you use the tool that comes with the board. They're like tweezers. Insert, pull straight up. There will be a little resistance, which can scare you if you aren't sure you're doing it right, but you are. Doing it right.

One minor odd thing I found with my keys are that some of them bleed a little bit of light out through streaks on their sides (usually the side facing me). Not all. Just some. Like they hadn't been painted completely black. Again, very minor.

Overall, purchased it here for $119.99. Slightly more expensive than the ballpark for non-RBG ""gaming"" mechanical keyboards (though I also choose the brown switches, the other switches are cheaper and smack dab in the same pricing as its competitors). The aluminum base was worth it, as well as not having to deal with extra gimmicky ""macro"" buttons.

Compared to Corsair's Strafe (non-RGB model), I'd choose the K70, due to multiple different switches, aluminum base (Strafe is all plastic), and dedicated media buttons. The only direct comparison would be if you use red switches, and there's only a $10 difference there, which I think the build quality of the K70 is worth.",Terrible reliability.

However, I like many others, canceled my pre-order when I discovered that I was not actually going to be buying the game, even though I was going to be spending $50 on it.

The truth is that this game comes with a new generation of digital rights management software called SecuROM. This DRM system does many things.

First, if your gaming computer does not have internet access then you cannot activate and play the game at all. Bioware/EA does not want your business.

Second, Bioware allows you three 'activations' only. Activations are tied to your computer's hardware and operating system configuration. If you ever reinstall windows, or upgrade a videocard, or add a new hard-drive, or even a simple cooling fan, you will need to use up another activation to keep playing mass effect on your computer. Several customers used up all three activations within a couple of weeks of buying the game as they tried reinstalling windows, or upgrading hardware, to overcome technical difficulties. Once you run out of activations and try to play the game again, you get a message informing you that you have no more activations left and that you should buy another copy of the game to get more. If you do some searching, you will find out that EA says that they may provide you more activations, on a case by case basis, if you contact them. They refuse to state what circumstances will be considered acceptable to them before allowing you more activations. At a minimum, you may need to provide a copy of your purchase receipt. You do actually keep your purchase receipts for $50 games right?

Third, SecuROM is a highly controversial piece of software. Its existence is not disclosed on the box, nor do you get notified that it is being installed on your machine. SecuROM installs registry keys that are not deleted when you uninstall the game. And these registry keys use illegal characters to prevent the user from being able to delete them manually. You must use third-party software to do so.

Fourth, SecuROM can include a module that provides 'information' to the game publisher. Bioware claims it is not using that module to do so, but there is no way to verify this.

Fifth, Bioware cancelled the re-validate online every 5-10 days policy that they originally stated the game would have. Expect to see this return in future games.

Lastly, Bioware/EA provides no method to de-activate a computer once it has been activated. Uninstalling the game from one computer does not free up that activation. Therefore, your ability to sell your copy of the game second-hand, guaranteed in the Copyright Act (Doctrine of First Sale) has  been violated by Bioware/EA. Expect to see some lawsuits before too much longer.

If you think I'm blowing up the DRM issue out of proportion then, by all means, go ahead and buy this game. While you are able to play it I'm sure you'll be very happy with it. However, do not expect to be able to keep playing it years into the future without paying extra for more activations.

The same DRM system is also intended for use on EA games like Spore, and likely also Dragonage, plus many others.

If you are concerned about this kind of practice becoming the industry standard, then I urge you not to spend your money on this game or any other titles from EA until they abandon this DRM fiasco. There are games publishers who take a different approach (for example, the game Sins of a Solar Empire is DRM free) and who are much more appreciative of your custom.",Rental versus purchase: Beware,1213747200,"1,041",{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

Rocksmith is a great learning tool and definitely a lot of fun. There is a huge amount of satisfaction in actually learning to play a song instead of devoting hours to pressing plastic buttons on a guitar-shaped controller. It's just too bad the game is so buggy.

The underlying technology is pretty impressive. Things look decent. Things sound great. The note detection works very well most of the time, and the scrolling notation is very easy to read.

For a while, my only real complaint with this game was the UI. It's just a mess to navigate, and it's very easy to accidentally back all the way out of one section of the game into another, triggering a long loading screen. In general, it's just unintuitive, the kind of interface that has you mumbling, ""no, that's not what I meant to do."" But all of that is not enough to greatly diminish the value of the game.

What does greatly diminish the value of this title is that it is INCREDIBLY buggy and unstable. There are moments where the scrolling notes stall or lag for a second or two, times when the game crashes during loading or saving, locking up the entire console. It's just rough. It behaves like an early beta. Keep in mind this is with the most recent patch. Also, keep in mind that issues with the console itself have been ruled out and that similar complaints are found throughout the official Ubisoft forums for Rocksmith.

The real kicker is that the stability gets worse and worse the more DLC you add. If you never buy any songs for this game, you may be fine. If you buy a very large amount, eventually the game can't even get past the initial loading screens anymore. So if you're really into the game, and you buy a lot of songs, the game is essentially guaranteed to completely stop working at some point. From what Ubisoft support tells me there are no plans to correct this with a patch. Their advice is to manually manage the installed DLC, only keeping a few songs installed at a time then deleting them and redownloading another set. They wouldn't even advise me what a ""safe"" amount is. Ridiculous.

This is a product that was just never ready for retail and is basically not being supported by the publisher at all.

Note that these experiences are specific to the PS3. I can't really speak to the stability on other systems.

My recommendation is to wait until Rocksmith 2014 comes out in a few months. The current version of the game basically doesn't work, at least not on the PS3.",PS3 Version Unplayable with DLC,1371772800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was looking for a game that I can customize the car itself. A few people recommended this one but it seems like you can only do this after you have completed the game and not before. After I complete the game I probably will never play it again... I hate when games places so many restrictions on them and it's really stupid to do that.

Then, about 3 weeks later, I plugged them in and got nothing but a faint buzzing noise -- ZERO game audio. Tried every trick in the book to get them to work, but nothing. Now that they've broke on me, I'm unwilling to overlook the issues I had with them. I'll list those now.

The first issue I had with them appeared early on. You could hear rattling in one of the ear pieces. It sounded like a small ball bearing shaking inside the plastic ear piece. Secondly, the ear pieces are small & become quite uncomfortable after an hour or so playing; I found myself constantly having to take them off to avoid a headache. Third, they seem flimsy. This was a concern of mine because I had a TB headset before and they did not hold up well at all.

This review focuses on the one item exclusive to the Survival Edition, the PipBoy Clock. The clock is a poor product, plain and simple, and not worth $10 extra, much less the $50 over the Collector's Edition price.

Performance is terrible. The clock doesn't work unless you use some redneck engineering on it with aluminum foil inserts placed between the positive battery point and the positive contact plate. Once you get the batteries in and actually get power to the display, setting the time can itself is cumbersome. The three buttons provided are often times unresponsive, requiring a good deal of wiggling at times to get the display to change as desired. The display, even with fresh batteries, is very dim, very hard to interpret unless the room it's in is very dark.

In terms of power consumption, it devours batteries, consuming three AA batteries every two weeks, sometimes sooner. In comparison, the old one-way pager I carry for my job, which has an alarm, storage for phone numbers and time received, and makes some rudimentary sounds if desired, uses one AAA battery every MONTH or so. This clock doesn't even have an alarm, and uses much more power for it.

Aesthetically, the clock is a mixed bag. The overall design and look match the Fallout universe exactly. My example, however, arrived unpainted, looking nothing like I expected it to look. I know the technology and ""look and feel"" of the game series is ""used retro science fiction"", but this clock is as drab as drab gets, with no logos or anything to maintain that sense of having something form the Fallout world, even if it's a fake. Further, the clock was at one point supposed to be wearable like the PipBoy used in the game. That too, has been nullified by poor craftsmanship.

Furthermore, the level of customer service provided for this clock from amazon.com and Bethesda SoftWorks, the game's license holder, is incredibly underwhelming. For one, in order to get any warranty work done on it, you must send in money, and the clock, to some company in California that no one's ever heard of. So for yet more money you lose possession of a broken clock that originally only cost you $50. Compare this sort of ""service"" to the defective&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gears-of-War-2-Amazon-com-Exclusive-Lancer/dp/B001CLYL24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gears of War 2 Amazon.com Exclusive Lancer</a>. When the NECA Lancer had its own battery issue, similar to the one described above, NECA and amazon.com worked to fix it somehow. NECA sent out replacement parts, for free, in a timely manner if you contacted them. amazon.com handed out $10 coupons good for the next purchase on ANYTHING they sell. Wither that level of customer service from amazon.com and Bethesda SoftWorks for this quasi-defective clock?

All in all, SAVE YOUR MONEY. The Collectors' Edition gives you so much more value, with the lunchbox and bobblehead being the best collectibles this year. With incredibly poor workmanship, lack of attention to detail, unknown warranty service from a company whose reliability can't be ascertained, and overall price point, this clock simply is not worth the extra $50 price.",Shoddy Clock Not Worth Extra Price,1228176000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It was unreal.) -- there have been multiple reports of being threatened with a total account ban if you dare dispute their refund policy.

So this is what it comes down to: dispute it on your credit card or through your bank.

I don't think I've ever had a dispute of mine turned down, because they've all come down to this basic idea: you're not getting what you paid for.

I strongly urge anybody interested in purchasing a PS3 to do some research prior to see if they are comfortable with the changes that get made. Sony loves to update the firmware on this thing- sometimes for no other reason than to take away features (or add features that inadvertently brick/kill some consoles). They've spent a ton of time on 'security updates'- while leaving things like some of the most voted for features out.

In recent memory-

* firmware update killed the ""other O/S"" feature. You could install linux and such and use it as a little computer. I am particularly miffed about that one. They claimed it was to patch a hole that was a security concern. Oddly enough - a USB device came out afterwards that allowed pirating of things anyways. If you chose not to update- you cannot play games online, you can't update the BR portion of the unit, etc.

*most models do not have backwards compatibility. Not so much a cost saving measure so much as they want to sell the stuff that would've been backwards compatible as re-releases or through the PS Store.

*newest firmware update kills some USB devices (thumb drives, portable hard drives, etc), unofficial controllers, flight sticks, and more. This was to address the hole that came apparent after they nixed the O/S feature.

I pre-ordered a 60gb hardware bc system, picked it up launch day. Let me say now that Uncharted 1/2 are amazing. Resistance is awesome. There are a ton of really great games out there, and as a Blu-Ray player- it is one of the best. That being said- as a gaming machine, the company's policies are absolutely terrible and are not in favor of the buyer at all (and seem to be getting worse). Not a fanboy here- not a fanboy rant. I want to keep loving the system- but Sony makes it so terribly hard. It's a shame- play Wipeout and tell me that there's a better futuristic racer out there right now!

And the kicker. If one breaks- it's $150 + shipping to have it repaired. I've been through a few Xbox 360's (though the new model is rock solid). I am not out a penny with those RROD's. I lost a PS3- and it cost awful close to $200 to get fixed. It died again within 8 months (with proper orientation and ventilation). I got that repair for free (though I had to cover shipping). As it stands now, I am not hooking that unit to the internet and losing any more functions/features.

So- long story short- if you want to watch BR's- it's amazing. If you don't care about functions/features being removed down the road, then go for it. If you don't care about repair costs (or are prepared to fight on the phone- they cut freebies sometimes for people who have had to get multiple repairs), then it's not a bad system. I just strongly urge anybody considering a purchase to take some time and research the pros/cons of the units and see if any of the things (or other issues) are deal breakers.",Strongly reccomend you research first,1285286400,60,,

It's a remastered edition of Saints Row IV with 1080p resolution and a few enhancements. While the enhancements aren't really anything to bark about, the game itself is of Volition's usual ""good job"".

""Good Job"": Now, when I use these words, it isn't in a way to give positive reinforcement to the developers. Anyone who has played Saints Row IV last generation might remember the problems that the game suffered during it's early days. It took months for them to release the patches to get the get up to par. The same is unfortunately true in this generation of Saints Row IV. I mean, the matchmaking is something in this generation that I suspect to be broken. I couldn't even get it to work, to connect with ONE person. The game also crashes, it's happened to me atleast two times in one day.

The Good Side: What to expect out of the Re-Elected version? Every piece of DLC that was released on the PS3 plus the game Gat out of Hell.

Gate out of Hell: You've heard my complaints about the Re-Elected version of Saints Row IV. Now comes my thoughts on Gat out of Hell. It has a nice premise, but frankly speaking, this should have been the new Saints Row of the generation. Make it longer and give people the chance to stomp on the minions of Hell as Johnny Gat, yes please. But I found it a bit too dark visually.

1. the maps are garbage and everything is ridiculously fast paced, just like COD. I paid for battlefield, not COD.
2. The vehicles are complete trash. I'm mainly referring to the ground based vehicles. It's literally unbearable to drive any of them. The cars from ""true crimes:Streets of LA"" have better handling then this game.
3. There's no variety of weapons. This is a huge issue in my opinion.
4. The  graphics are lagging.
5. It doesn't bring the battlefield realism that they typically have.

 it up to two stars.

Update: I did actually break this disc in half. I played it at a buddy of mines recently and it's still a terrible game..somehow worse actually. I reduced this to one stars for a few reasons:
- they price dropped this game from $60-$39 quicker than any game I've ever seen, demonstrating desperation and the need to sell before all potential buyers get wind of how terrible this game is.
- the customer service I spoke of on their Facebook page isn't actialky that great. They'll reply with ""oh tell us how this game sucks"" and once you give a legit reason, they don't reply. If you say you like it however, they reply.
- I've never seen so many fake 5 star reviews for a game. It's really despicable how EA is that desperate for this game to not show its true rating from actual people. EA, stop manipulating votes, your game is trash.

Based on the 1985 hit movie you play teenager Marty McFly as he travels back to 1955 trying to fix the future he accidentally screwed up.
You start off in the middle of town and must work your way through an obstacle course of killer bees and random objects thrown in your way.  Add to that you must collect clocks to keep the picture of your family from fading out.  Now that is clever I will give them that.  But bees?  Once you reach the end of the stage you will face off against different finally challenges.  From Biff and the gang to flying hearts from your mom.
And thats it.  The blueprint for every stage!  Until you finally get in the Delorean, and then if you fail to hit 88 MPH when you hit the wire, well then you get to start over again.
The game isn't the worst LJN game.  But it just sucks in general.  Repetitive stages and has barely any tie in with the movie.  Theme is just painted on.  There are plenty of great games on the Nintendo.  This isn't one of them.","You're The Doc, Doc",1411084800,,,

""This is a review of the Product. Not the game only, but the product itself listed above.

The product installs a great game. That being said, it also installs spyware/malware onto my computer. This is the same type of software that I have paid programs to remove for years. Why would a user want to install it deliberately onto their machine?

If you buy this product, know that one day it will cease to work. I don't care if it is 6 months from now, or 10 years from now. You are not buying an actual product, you are renting it until you change your computer a total of 3 times. Considering I have 6 computers on my network alone, and I use at least 3 of those as gaming rigs, I know this would be relatively quick for me. Either way, you will most likely not be able to dig this out of the closet in 10 years and nostalgically play. You are buying a self destructing product.

The DRM on this game does not do anything to limit piracy as the company says. Spore itself was already downloaded DRM free 100k some-odd times before the game was even released. SecuROM is not a DRM scheme, as it does nothing to prevent piracy. It does everything to limit the value of the product to the legit customer and prevent them from selling it to a second party. This has been proven an illegal practice in multiple lawsuits throughout the years, however they continue to install the software on end users computers without their consent.

I am not a pirate. If I was a pirate, I would probably already be happily playing this game instead of being here writing this. Again, no pirates need to complain about DRM. They are usually busy playing the game free. ""","Well, another DRM failure from them",1224720000,5,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

I made the assumption everyone would go with the Xbox one but instead they bought PS4s. This isn't a negative point for the Xbox One but its important to see if who you are playing with now is upgrading to it otherwise you need new friends. I work in a field that requires a lot of secrecy ie no cell phones at work, background checks on new people you meet etc. The idea of this always listening creeped me out so I wanted to see if what I was saying was sent to servers to be processed like siri. I looked into what the xbox was doing on my home network and it always sending and receiving data I disconnected the camera and this crippled the experience (Data usage was lower) and keeping it offline ruins the whole reason I bought the system. These two reasons are both situational but everyone should value what little privacy they have because you always have less than you think.

My primary reason for not being able to justify the console was it would not play any files on my online FTP server or my networked hard drive they all worked fine all my 360 and $25 Raspberry Pi. 70 percent of the time I use my tvs to watch movies or tv shows I downloaded and im a cable cutter so the HDMI passthrough serves no purpose.

In summary I wish I had researched my decision more especially media playback and privacy concerns. I will probably buy a PS4 and keep my Raspberry PI running Xbian and keep my Xbox One in storage until I see a future update that disables the voice services and improves media playback.

Positives:
.Next generation gaming looks great
.The console looks professional in a home theater setup.
.A future update can fix all my issues.(If theirs a way to fix now please comment!)

UPDATE: I've been using this console without kinect to play xbox only games but overall I still enjoy my PS4 better and use a fire tv for my media needs.

This game is horrible, and if you say otherwise you're in bad need of therapy because you're so desperate for a video game that you've convinced yourself this is worthy of your time.

Or maybe your time is truly that worthless...in which case you should contemplate drastic measures.

First off, the game is VERY linear.  ""Call of Duty 2"" truly felt like an open battlefield, whereas this one feels like a ride at Disneyland.  Sure the scenery is beefed up and beautiful, but how about those character animations?  The mouths aren't synched to the dialogue, and they do that mindless hand-waving thing when they talk...just like all cinematics did back on the PS1 and N64.

The AI is horrible.  In Call of Duty 2 you couldn't just hold your crosshairs in the same spot and wait for the idiot German to pop up in the same place so you could plug him.  In this one you CAN---but you just don't care to.

Also---""IT'S GLITCHERIFFIC!""  I shot a German and he flew straight up into the air, completely off the top of the screen!  I snuck up behind another German and hit him with a melee attack----the friggin' dude did two front flips and flew like twenty yards.  Mind you, he was in the standing position the entire time.  Not unlike tossing an action figure across the yard.

This game left a stale taste in my mouth, and really just pissed me off.  Call of Duty 2 was 360's only killer app.  If nothing else these people need to realize that once you have a great game---all we really want as gamers is a great big expansion pack!  They could've added 12 more hours of additional content to Call of Duty 2's campaign missions and I would've paid $60, cash on the barrelhead son.

There's some good scares and i cant deny i would of liked it if it was just full screen but it's a complete deal breaker.

So I bought these cables and they worked fine; the picture was better and everything that I said it was and everthing was fine. Then I tried to move the system and I had to take the cable out. Now I remember it being a tight fit going in, but some cables are just like that, but getting them out was ridiculous. I tried to be gentle but it just split in half leaving the connector in my system and the casing in my hand. Not cool. I took some needle nose pliers to get them out, and taped the casing together around the connector. It worked once more and I was willing to just accept that. I was then having trouble with my DC and had to take them out again, same thing happened. Now they don't work at all.

My reccomendation now is to get the VGA box.

Many people have a VGA option on their HD sets anymore and even if you're just using the S Video option it's nice to have everything there.

If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.

But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had.

First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.

Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.

And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.

When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!

1.0,False,"08 18, 2008",A1JR3Q4PND5G7Q,B000WSE2WM,Wade A. Hampton,"I really REALLY wanted to like this game. I saw the commercials with the sharp graphics and witty funny dialogue and thought 'This is going to be a great game' right?WRONG!And I am sorry to say this. Now,I play a lot of first person shooter games and some are better than others obviously. But I've never played one that had so much promise and failed in almost every concievable way possible. Now,before I get to the terrible parts let me start with the very few positive available.

Lets start off with the graphics. They are very realistic and you'll be surprised great they are. The best I've seen in a game of this type so far. The duel acessories/weapon selection is cleaver. You can repair any vehicle pretty fast with a rivot-type gun which is useful. And the dialogue the men in Bad Company during the campaign is actually pretty funny and comedy is certainly a nice change of pace in a game about war and death. And the coolest part of the game is actually firing the Artillery pieces with a airial view a lot of fun especially online.

Now,here comes the bad parts which are considerable so bare with me through all of them. Let's begin on the game mechanics. Selecting weapons are cumbersome and awkward. You'll shuffle through one only to realize that you skipped it. And you would think that the standard L1-R1 weapon select system would have been more than adequate to easily get the job done,but L1 selects the acessories and R1 selects weapons. Secondary weapons like a attached grenade launcher should be on L2 and use R2 to fire,but disappointingly enough it's an acessory so you have to select it with L1 which is more than awkward especially in the heat of battle. The reticles are almost useless and is hard to guage if you even have your target on it and the recoil moves it around so much you easily lose track of the enemy. Rocket Launchers are underpowered especially up close where they shoulb be the most effective like hitting a guy in the chest and him not dyingAnd a lot of the weapons you use online and unlockable ones you need special codes and they are extremely hard to get and then even more can only the be unlocked only if you'd pre order the game LAME!

Now to the campaign-The story is the backbone to any first person shooter and without one severely dilutes the online part which it does a lot. The whole concept is about finding enemy Gold and smuggling it out so everyone there can retire. Although this sounds like this is a great idea and a novel concept it's actually becomes stale and boring very quickly. Like I said I had no problem with the voice acting,but some may find it to be dumb and repetitive. Also,the intro just throws you into a Russian-type country without any backstory or explanation on how and why you are there which is the biggest flaw in the game. A good portion of the enemy A.I. even on the highest difficulty are dumb and are easy targets.

And finally Online-There are only two settings(Gold Rush and Conquest mode).And you can only get Conquest Mode only if you download it off of XBOX Live and please do it's head over shoulders better that playing Gold Rush by far. There is absolutely to talking in this game which I found wierd in a game so strategic as this one. At first I thought my Mic was broken,but then soon discovered after playing several consecutive games that there's simply isn't any at all. This might be a good thing however,because there is a lot of Team Killing that occurs. And I do mean a lot of it. This was preveilent in the first Battlefield game,but no where near the level that it is now. The HUD is useles as well. It doesn't show you where your team is at accurately and enemies appear as little tiny dots that you can barely see. But you don't have to worry much about this,because Snipers rule this game. You'll get picked off from a thousand yards away and have no idea what happened until it's too late. And don't ever EVER get into a vehicle especially a Helicopter with your Teammates around,because they will deliberately shoot at you until you die or the vehicle is rendered completely useless. Most players also have better weapons available that you do and if you're up against them you might as well leave the game. You only have about five maps to play on and only two of those are worth playing. The are big a bit too big and although you can select which spawn point you select,by the time you get into the battle the actual fighting is now a thousand miles away from you and you'll find yourself running or driving to the front lines.

Overall this game is a big disappointment. If you expect a great game you'll be sadly mistakened. I lay all the blame on the makers of the game who should have realized all of these problems and actually fix them. They deserve a special award for poor game design and flawed unsupervised online game play. And a thrown together jumbled mess of a story line. I could actually go on with more problems with the game,but that would drag this review even further. If you have to play this game I suggest you rent it,DO NOT buy this game! It's a waste of time and money. To finish all I have to say is this game might very well be the biggest disappointment of any video game and any genre I've ever seen and I hope I have given you all the information you need to avoid such a dreadful game as this one turned out to be.",Battlefield Bad Game!,1219017600,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In this one you have two options: three real players, or by yourself. You can't play with just two players unless you do the coliseum, which isn't actual gameplay, just sloppy PvP.  If playing locally you can both connect to the internet and find a third person, but I would much rather be able to play in say a car or a plane with my friend or brother without having to rely on an awkward third person to get started.

Now that I've had time to beat it entirely, I'll say this is the worst Zelda game I have played since Zelda II on the NES. Unless you can play it exactly, and I mean exactly how Nintendo intended for it to be played, which is with three competent players with a solid enough internet connection that you don't EVER disconnect, this is an unplayable mess. In single player you're given 2 'dopples' which are basically dolls you can control periodically, and why they couldn't let two players connect and have the third as a dopple is beyond me. While at first this seems alright, it's when you get into the later levels of the game you realize it was definitely made for THREE people and no less. This creates an enormous challenge for some bosses and timing puzzles that need all three players to do something simultaneously, which is near impossible on single player.

But don't fear! Using a life, you can skip the level entirely. This results in fewer rewards, not that they matter whatsoever unless you are a completionist, but also means you can immediately continue to the next level. In the end you'll be doing the three regular levels of a certain section then skipping the boss with a life. Sure, you can say ""I'll never use them"" but the fact that the option is so easy to use makes me believe Nintendo had to put it there so you could complete some of the levels without wasting a ridiculous amount of time trying to perfectly time three Links on your own.

I really wish Nintendo would make a Zelda game like Mario 3D World with drop in-out co-op, rather than a game based around such an awkward number of required players. Even Zelda Four Swords Adventures, which is a fun game, failed miserably in my eyes with the insane requirement of all players needing a Gameboy Advanced and a cable to connect it to the GameCube. If co-op is going to be so bad in this series, Nintendo needs to avoid it completely and just make more handheld Zelda's as great as Link Between Worlds which is easily my second favorite Zelda game.","NO two player support, BAD single player experience",1445558400,20,,

Diablo 3 requires a constant internet connection at all times. Drop your connection, drop your game, start from your last save. Blizzard claims that they want their online auction house to work so they have to require online. From what I remember of D2 you had to have separate characters for online and offline. This would a great idea for D3 because they would still do their silly auction house, where people will get ripped off by the ones and zeros that Blizzard puts out for people who want to pay out more. They're going to turn it into a ""pay to win"" style game.

Online always means no mods. The only way you'll ever get mods for this game is if you get a pirated version of this game. It's pretty sad. Games like the elder scrolls had amazing mods and didn't have the hilariously stupid drm.

NO LAN. again I'm going to say it. NO LAN. you'll have to have excellent internet for you want your buddies to be able to play together. I like to be able to banter with my friends in the same room. Not all of us have or want to pay for fast internet. It's so sad to see developers stop support for LAN

Blizzard merged with Activision. They don't care about customer input. They're pretty arrogant of their prices. They're still trying to sell the original Starcraft for $20. IT CAME OUT IN 1996! Let it drop. All their other game keep their prices as well. In my opinion Valve has a lot better thing going for them. They'll release a game and keep the price high during it's prime marketable time and then they bring in to a reasonable price. Blizzard doesn't listen. They deserve 0 stars if I could give it to them. I like the old blizzard back in the day when they cared about customers.",No LAN no buy.

1.0,False,"11 22, 2011",A34UVV757IKPVB,B000R0SS3Y,Steve K,"This game looks great, but plays TERRIBLE.
The first thing you should know, is that this game has a god-awful camera angle to it.  I was constantly re-centering the thing, or would be walking in one direction, only to have the camera angle change and my guy would start walking off to the side.  When fighting swarms of enemies, it's impossible to see the people hitting you from behind your character, and that's even after messing with the camera-toggle moving it as far away as possible.  It's just not smooth at all.
Second, this game is trying to be some kind of action-rpg, but you constantly collect so many pieces of armor or weapons or gems or whatever, that you find yourself going into your equipment menu ALL THE TIME to see if that thing you just picked up is a better piece of armor then the one you are wearing.
Third, the game makes no sense.  After watching the movies and whatever - I have NO idea who I am or what I'm fighting against.  I was at the point that when a nonsensical cutscene came along, I would just pick up my phone and check my email.
Fourth, there's ZERO challenge to the game.  Sure, you can level up and get better armor and weapons, but YOU DON'T DIE in the game, so what's the point?  When you die, you have to sit through this annoyingly repetitive cutscene (check phone for email again!) and just start right off near where you died.  So you find yourself just holding down the trigger or holding down the right stick to attack over and over and over again until you die.  Come back to life - repeat - hold down trigger until you die again.  It's not fun.
Fifth, the voice acting is laughable.  Many cut scenes don't quite line up and the dialog is atrocious.  Many times while playing, your ""team"" will say the DUMBEST stuff; ""Think that's the last of 'em?""  Yeah - I've killed 2000 of those enemy-robot-alien whatevers and I'm sure THAT was the last one.  ""Medic!"" - a) there's no medic and b) you never die anyway so what are you crying about?
Sixth, your team is LAME.  They do very little, get lost most of the time, and make NO sense in their existence.  Either they die off (they get reborn at random times?) or get lost or just completely disappear.  Oh but don't worry, you'll still hear their annoyingly repetitive dialog CONSTANTLY, even when they AREN'T THERE.

It LOOKS like a decent game - a lot of thought went into the weapons and graphics and stuff, it just plays like utter GARBAGE.  I won it in about a week or so, and plan on throwing it out.  I'm glad I paid like $5 for it used.  This is easily the best-looking worst-playing game on the XBox 360, EVER.",Best looking worst game ever.,1321920000,4,,
1.0,True,"10 16, 2013",A23FK1X6FGR9RS,B001LVH80M,spazzychalk,"Before you even open the box, you see NES SNES Genesis G-Force. What's G-force? I googled it. Nobody seems to know. Some people thing maybe it's the gun? Sounds like another system to me. The box even shows an extra slot for the G-Force carts.

Speaking of another system, a machine that plays NES and SNES and is named ""FC"" is also intentionally misleading - it does not play FamiCom or Super FamiCom (Japanese NES & SNES). They don't fit.

On the back of the console there is an O/J switch. The unit comes with no instruction book and the instructions on the back of the box make no mention of what it is. What does it do? That's for archaeologists to figure out.

It has 2 Genesis controller ports on the front that play the special custom controller and no other ports. Every other system has multiple controller hookups for every system it plays so you can use your original controllers. This only plays its own controllers. Bad luck for you if one dies or you like to play the proper controller.

I haven't even plugged this thing in yet and I'm already irritated with it......

And then I turned it on....

I've had the Gen-x Duo and the Retron 3, this has by FAR the best quality video output. The unit renders the picture as good as the original AND adds sidebars so it is not stretched out on today's widescreen TVs. The colors are much more true to the original compared to the other 2, the picture more crisp/bright/sharp and the colors are true - something I can't say for either of the other machines.

This, like every other system that is combined NES & Sega, uses the backwards NES button map, crossing A and B. Since you can't plug in a genuine controller, you're stuck with it. (Genesis Controller is ABC, NES is B A - This unit switches the NES to AB, reversing the button map)

The machining tolerances on the cartridge doors are loose, so loose that you can actually stick the NES cart in and hit the wrong spot leaving you feeling around for the hole in the dark.

Pulling some of the NES carts out is also hard, the circuit board reader is too tight and sometimes doesn't want to let go.

The gun is useless also. We all know the original NES guns don't work on modern flatscreens because the system can't read the 120hz screen, it is looking for the 60hz flash of the old glass TVs. That being said, THIS ISN'T A 1980s NINTENDO GUN. THIS IS A BRAND NEW MACHINE. There is **NO*** accecptable reason why the gun shouldn't be designed to work on modern TVs.

This system is also having problems reading NES carts that work in my Retro 3. Blank screens, squares of gibberish, etc. All of my games have immaculate contacts, professionally polished in brand new condition. It's not dirt, this thing just won't play them, like the ROM is dead but these games are known to be good.

After less than a week the power supply died, taking the whole system with it. Even if it didn't it wouldn't be worth keeping, it only plays some of the games",Worst 3-in-1 system on the market,1381881600,,,

But the most frustrating part is that the final battle which is very long and has an exponentially increased level of difficulty from the rest of the game. I played on Normal up until the Zeppelin battle which is so bad it left me wishing the developers responsible for this rot in Hell. Not to mention the story seems to be written by drug addicts.

The overall art (but especially the steam-punk themed flying city) was the only part I liked in this game.

The controls are frustrating when using vigors, since you can only have two that you can switch between with a press of a button, to equip others you need to hold the left bumper and select from a menu. I did put up with it through the game, but the last battle may require swift selection of the vigor that's best for a given enemy (for example I wanted to switch from Crows to Shock Jockey when going from battling foot soldier to engaging Patriots) and that's where the controls really suck.

THIS IS AN ""ONLINE ONLY GAME"". Regardless of its ""free to play"", you are required to have ""internet"", an ""Xbox Live Account"" (for this platform version), and will be required to accept an ""End User License Agreement"" every time you play this game.
Because this product's functionality is BASED primarily on the functionality of the servers from Trion Worlds and their ability to maintain them. END NOTATION***

--GAME INSTALLATION---------
-The Good: The game requires installation (especially since its now FREE to PLAY). The game disc ""DID"" requires 5.1g of space. Installed games run faster & take less time on load screens. When logging into the game you are taken to a character load screen, sometimes a window queue and how long it will take for you to get into a server to play.
-The Bad: Approximately EVERY TWO WEEKS since this game launched in 2013, this game gets an ""update"". That ""update"" or ""Patch"" is only obtainable at the speed by which Trion allows you to download it. From the very beginning over a year ago and to this very DAY this system HAS NOT CHANGED.
You will turn on the game, you will be required to download an update. Your Screen will briefly display your update speed, then remove that download speed from the screen, and display and estimated time of 3.5 to 4 HOURS to complete downloading the ""required to play"" update. After the update completes you WILL receive a window on your screen stating ""PATCH FAILURE"". You WILL end up needing to do it all AGAIN, and in the interim you will spend a minimum of EIGHT HOURS downloading an update... every two weeks... with NO certainty it will EVER WORK. Leaving you with a game you cannot play until maybe two weeks later, until ANOTHER ""update "" is required, which with 100% certainty will FAIL after its first download that takes four hours, that you will then be required to try again and spend a minimum of EIGHT HOURS attempting to download an update... again.
To date and the very moment I am finishing this review there have been 75 updates since launch of this game. That is 600 hours spent stuck downloading patches that always fail every two weeks. That is more time than Ive spent playing the game ITSELF.

--STORYLINE--------------
-The Good: Starts off with a brief cut scene, and then a tutorial. The NICE thing is the cut scenes (cinematic events developed with the game engine) include your designed character in them. The story line (without spoiling anything) is in my opinion is enough to keep you occupied and averagely entertained.
-The Bad: the game fails to allow you to play missions with friends 90% of the time. If you are lucky the ""Join Phase"" option MAY work. But more often than not you either get told ""YOU have lost connection to our servers"" or ""Identification Failure"" or ""This is a notification stating blame at you and not this company who made this game"".
--CHARACTER CREATOR---------
-You can pick from: Human Male, Human Female, Alien Male, Alien Female.
-Hair and hair color, Nose, Eyes, Facial structure, Mouth/Lips, Facial scars, Facial/Body tattoos... are all included in the character generator. The options available are enough to distinguish who you create, but are not vast enough to keep people from all picking the same ""cool looking"" hair style or ""cool looking"" tattoos. So keep in mind when creating your character that the one or two tattoos for the class your considering... alot of people may pick that too.
-The Bad: A character class is relevant to nothing but the gun you start with in the game. The skill tree for any class you pick is the same skill tree every other class has. All Trion did was randomize the boxes in the skill tree around into different positions. So no matter what class you pick, everybody has the same things, LITERALLY. Nothing differentiates you from anyone else other than what you look like. Which by the way... what you look like is replaced with a default male figure in a puffy jacket when around more than 5 players. So at large public events it resembles nothing more than a michilin man mosh pit where hundreds of puffy jacketed figures are running around. Theres no individuality to speak of unless you are standing in front of less than five people. It's a joke... a bad one.

--WEAPONS-------
The Good:-Pistols and magnums, shotguns and sawed off shotguns, assault rifles and light machine guns, submachine guns and high magazine auto pistols, grenade launchers and rocket launchers and MORE... can all have up to 4 attachments IF you find the attachments for the weapons you like. Those attachments are: Scopes, Stocks, Magazines, and Barrels.
-Weapons also can be found or bought in the world WITH ""synergy bonuses"".
-Attachments go on weapons into Slots. Attachments can be found or bought in the world WITH ""synergy bonuses"".
-Both weapons AND attachments can be found or bought with elemental damages which apply to weapons.

The Bad: -Slots can be placed on weapons when you reach the required level. That required level changes based on Trions currentlt running hotfix or patch version. So if you have a weapon with no slots you can place slots on that weapon by paying a form of in-game money (Ark Salvage). This has become a problem, because through various updated patches the expense of placing slots on weapons has gone from more than double what it use to cost, on top of the fact that as you level up in the game, the costs to place slots goes up as well. The base stats on all weapons remain static and don't change no matter your level. The more you level, the more salvage is required to modify a weapon, the more you modify it the more it requires to BE ""modified"", and after achieving the max modifications of a weapon the changes made are literally and mathematically so small that they would go unnoticed if compaired to another weapon never modified at all. So the bottom line is the weapon modification system is completely a waste of time.
The WORSE: - the items in this game known as ""Orange Items"" which would be considered as the ""Most rare"" are primarily obtainable by paying REAL money into a roulette reward system. Whether you are on the official forums, youtube, wherever... Trion Worlds has designed the game to clearly benefit those willing to pay real money and reward them with items in game that have ""Bonus Statistics"". These purchases are made with ""Bits"". ""Bits"" are bought with ""Microsoft Points"", ""Microsoft Points"" are bought with real money. These bonus statistics are so small and minute that when compared to weapons in game without those bonuses you would never know they exist. Im talking differences that are 1 tenth of a whole number. A simple example would be a gun with a firerate of 10. If you pay Trion real money you may get a gun that has a fire rate of 11.2 at most. The longer the game has been out, the more expensive Trion has made in-game costs. The higher the costs, the less you can do, the less you can do, the more inventory you have to carry, and for that they sell space via BITS so you can carry more. Its disgusting.

--GAMEPLAY--(Youre lucky if it works. Youll feel like you won 25 bucks off a scratch ticket for five minutes IF the game functions without an issue)
-During the game dynamic events called ""Ark Falls"" transpire. Ark Falls are when pieces of major objects orbiting the planet fall to the Earth carrying with them technology that upgrades your weapons. Trion has INCREASED everything it costs in the game to ""play"" the game, and DECREASED the ratio at which what you need to pay in the game is obtained via their patches.... unless you buy it using real money.
-During gameplay you will regularly get kicked from Trions servers with notifications stating ""Your connection to our servers has timed out"".
-During gameplay you will regularly lose your ability to see your friends IN the game. The option/s in place to resolve this issue has not resolved it since launch day.
-During gameplay the current patches have devised a system by which you are forcibly stuck with an extremely poor UI and an overwhelming amount of items that are designed to clearly take up your inventory space, only providing you with an option to pay real money to buy that space via microtransactions.
-There is no ability to play the game ""IF"" you cannot SUCCESSFULLY achieve updating your console with the most current patches from Trion Worlds Inc. Normally a patch takes 2-3 HOURS to download (regardless of your connection speed Trion has set pre-set speeds at which your download is achievable from them). These patches, taking 2-3 hours each, transpire at minimum every 2 weeks. That's not including random server down times from server crashes, server maintenance, server resets, and randomly scheduled hot fixes for their servers that despite saying ""will not interfere with your gameplay"" on their main web page, disconnects everyone from their servers for up to 12 hours at a time.
This game ""WAS"", and Im saying ""WAS"" playable within the first 30 days of its launch date. I severely recommend you NOT invest ANYTHING in this game. It was worth time when it first came out, but due to the current IP laws and how this developer has COMPLETELY DESTROYED this product POST-launch it is NO LONGER a game worth recommending. Your time WILL BE WASTED. Not only do I not recommend the game, I don't recommend the developer for any game they will ever make.

Buy DESTINY.
Defiance over the last 15 months is a broken game that only crossed 500k units in its sales, and the developer turned everything in it into a MONEY SCAM. Literally. The game rewards you with things you cant use unless you BUY the DLC the reward is associated with. The items you can use become useless every two weeks via a patch designed to downgrade what you have and upgrade what you haven't bought with real money.
If you don't believe me, go get the game. Go ahead... *shrug*

The refuse to fix -
- Massive lag and frame rate drops especially during combat
- NPC's appear right in front of you
- NPC's shape shift and change costumes right before your eyes as if the game is shuffling them around trying to load the map ahead
- Combat commands are extremely slow to respond

Major flaws in the game -
- Arno looks and acts like Billy Zane (the rich husband of Kate Winslet in Titanic)
- Storyline is short and convulted

Electronic Arts Says:
""Authorization limits
... you are limited to five authorizations. So what's an authorization? The first time you actually run the game on a machine, we will authorize that machine. If you reach the authorization limit, the game will not run on a new machine. If you make major changes to the computer (switching out multiple pieces of hardware, install a new OS, etc.) you might need to reauthorize the machine.""

What they don't mention here is that a ""major change"" to your computer can be quite a bit less than changing out multiple pieces of hardware. In fact, changing a keyboard, mouse, or joystick or any number of USB devices could be regarded as a ""major change"". Upgrading drivers for you sound or video card might be a major change. The rules are not defined and you will not know for sure what may or may not use up an authorization.

So if you use up all of your Authorizations? Electronic Arts says:
""Just give us a call...
If you had a run of bad luck, some hardware failures, a botched OS install, your notebook was stolen, you spilled a coke on your keyboard - you get the idea - and all five of your authorizations have been used up, just give us a call. We'll work with you and provide as many additional authorizations as are appropriate.""

What they fail to mention here is that calling Electronic Arts for technical support is not free. You will be charged 2.50/minute plus any toll charges.

Now consider the idea that you have bought 5 Electronic Arts games over time and one by one they all run out of authorizations. When the authorizations start running out, do you honestly want to call EA every time you make a hardware change to ask them to allow you to play a game you already paid for? What a hassle!

The voice acting is something out of a bad B flick porno flick, down to the random missing timings: people talk over each other. The story is, meh. And the game play and controls are without polish. The model animations are randomly OK or horrible (notice the first scene where people keep falling, how everyone falls the same and their hands are floating off the ground).

They attempted context sensitive controls... attempted. It either over shoots, gives you the text as if you can perform an action, but you can't (for example, holding a sword prevents you from picking up items, but it says you can - lack of polish).

Overlooking all the graphics and voice issues, I gave the game a chance based on it's gameplay. The controls were impossible. Not over complex, just, again (word of the day), unpolished. Easy, fixable issues were overlooked, and are now ingrained as standard (I mention this as not to imply they will ever fix them; they will not, they are now expected). For example, you attack/action the direction your character is facing, not the direction you are pushing on your control stick. So, in the middle of combat, you find yourself hitting enemies several times, you attempt to dodge out of the way, but you dodge at them, even though you are pushing away from them. Again, actions are based on your characters direction - this is a defect, contrary to how these types of games traditionally play.

There is no jump button, and trust me, you want to jump a lot. So it takes the road of Mega Man, big deal...? Still, I attempted to overlook these minor issues, but the fighting is so bad, I found nothing redeeming about this game.

Like another reviewer complained, it doesn't matter if your creature has fifty legs or half of one, evolution pretty much plays absolutely no role in crafting your creature at all.  It's entirely a creationist game, as your creature doesn't at all ""evolve"", but is changed to your specifications.  That is, you can start with a two legged mammal-looking thing with claws for lips, and if you don't like it, you can completely change it to be a legless worm with eight eyes and wings, and if you don't like that, you can make a velociraptor with huge kneecaps and beefy arms.  So long as you unlock more parts to create with, you have absolutely free reign to mold your creature like clay.

So the game clearly espouts creationism.

The cell stage is simple, but it's quite fun, with your quest to eat little bits of plant or meat, while avoiding larger cells, and you can gradually evolve to put on spikes to poke the crap out of enemies, or poison sacks or electric butts to kill your foes, while the gigantic spiked amoeba that ate you every time you zipped past will soon become your primary source of food.

Next, the Creature stage.  This is one of the most fun stages, as it consists of you controlling one of your creatures, hunting for food, either befriending other creatures by dancing, singing, and posing for them, or MURDERING them in front of their children, then eating their children in front of their women.

If the creature stage had blood, it would be a damn awesome experience.  It can be a sheerly brutal play, with great pleasure to be had in hunting species down to extinction, or chasing an enemy away from its nest, while cracking all their eggs, and murdering their children when they try to come close.  It's also the only stage where you can do as much of the creature crafting/creationising as you can.  My recommendation is to explore all you can, find all the parts you can, and pick what you like, because you cannot ""evolve"" anymore past this stage.

Tribal stage completely changes the gameplay, to something like a simplistic RTS where you hunt nonsentient creatures, or gather fruits and plants, and bring them back to camp, where food can be spent on musical instruments, weapons, or children.  The objective is to befriend and ally tribes, or destroy their village hut.  This stage is hell to go through, and is exacerbated by poor controls, an even poorer camera, constant raids on your food supply by tiny creatures that will literally camp on your food pile and suck as much as they can.

Civilization stage is just a big mess of things thrown together as filler.  You have to waste time designing EACH and EVERY building and vehicle from scratch using the same system as designing your creature, and the vehicle can be as overburdened with crap as you want so long as all the right stats are in place.  This stage exacerbates all the poor control and camera problems in the previous stage, and all the gameplay consists of literal ""Feng Shui"" as you must precisely place homes, factories, and entertainment centers to get the most happiness and productivity out of your city.  If you're on an island, don't even bother building too many military vehicles---there is absolutely no way to get them over water, not even by transport.

All the work in this stage is eventually rendered useless by the use of KIDDIE nuclear weapons, in particular the ICBM which destroys all cities that don't belong to you, and automatically moves you to the space stage.

Space stage is the next awesome phase, borrowing heavily from the creature phase with regards to controls and camera, and lets you explore the entire galaxy available at hand.  And since you're on your own, there's no need to micromanage a city full of idiots with shoddy controls.

So the Pros:

- Free-range creature creation (though it's very much impossible to make something humanlike)
- Bloodless murderous fun in Creature stage and Cell stage
- Being an obnoxious empire in the Space stage
- Low system requirements and small game size, while graphics and collision detection are still top-notch

Cons:

- Insanely boring Tribal and Civilization stages
- Insanely pointless Civilization stage (I beat this stage with nothing but military cities, no economy)
- Limited number of parts makes you roam around a huge map for hours looking for thirty different variations of deformed-toe feet
- Blatantly promoting creationism, thus allowing absolutely no role for evolution, and no purpose for any of the random appendages put on your creature save for the stats they grant.
- Camera controls are among the worst controllable-camera controls in any game I've ever played.
- Game controls post-Cell stage become sloppy and incoherent, causing such chestnuts in the Creature stage as trying to mate with another one of my kind, only to end up running past them and spinning in circles
- Too many things to handle in the Tribal stage with not enough creatures to carry out all these tasks
- Allies in every stage are completely useless for everything except not trying to kill you
- Definitely biased towards murderous carnivores, as it's easily up to 3 or 4 times harder to impress and ally with another nest/tribe than it is to simply butcher them all and eat their corpses in front of their children

As someone who played the flawless GOTY edition of Uncharted 2, I was in absolute shock with how horrible the single player experience is. The frame rate is chunkier than Honey Boo Boo's mother, the freaking game glitches constantly to game breaking effects such as enemies being hidden in objects or even the whole stage going to complete cluster clucks making it impossible to finish properly.

My biggest complaint is that you have to pay for EACH extra character. This means you can't explore other classes without having to delete your original character.

The most you can pay for this game is $22 bucks or so, which is obscene. Most games will give you the maximum allowed characters for a lump sum fee, what a predatory gimmick to increase monthly fees.

Like most Japanese RPGs these days, it's too slow and linear. The gameplay and interface with players and NPCs are not smooth at all, transitioning with lag times. The soundtrack and voices are also squeaky and annoying.

Problems I've experienced with just 2 hours of gameplay is: No widescreen support, ini tweak can solve this but then you will have missing textures. No lighting effects, you can see bulbs on and bright but emitting no rays on the ground, again ini tweak can fix this.

Well, Bleszinski, I decided to purchase Gears 3 anyway (in hopes that you had a second thought and listened to my feedback), and the problem of me not being able to kill with the lancer still remains.

I can easily kill with it in single player and horde mode, because the AI plays fair and allows me to shoot them. They don't run away and camp and snipe me and shotgun me like everyone does in multi-player. It's funny when there are cutscenes with gear soldiers killing with the lancer, as if that's possible in the game.

1.0,True,"06 4, 2015",A3UTKY931583ZG,B00C71033E,D. Elston,"So I'm a huge fan of the Metroid series and nearly any other game in the Metroidvania style ""explore, find stuff, get more powerful"" type of games.  I also really enjoyed the Arkham games.  I thought that's what Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate on 3DS was, so with that why not mix the two?  I finished the game, albeit painfully, and can say without question this is sub-par experience if you like ANY of the aforementioned titles.  I'll make it simple with a Pros/Cons list and follow up with some final thoughts:

PROS:
* Decent graphics, especially considering the limitations of the 3DS
* Cool, still-comic book style sequences to progress the story.  They're skippable which is nice when you die immediately after one over and over.
* It's Batman.

CONS:
* The 2.5D controls are terrible.  When in regular 2D mode, no problem, but when rounding a corner 3-dimensionally, I can't count how many times batman would double back on his previous location because the camera shifted and the controls changed with it.

* Far too many 1-mistake death areas.  All but maybe one boss fights are uninventive ""doing anything but this one secret action results in insta-death"".  I repeated most boss fights countless times because there was no clear way to approach the fight.  They all fail in making the bosses seem hard, but more just make batman look really pathetic...

* Unlike the other Arkham games, the fighting is pretty bland one-button mashing with a counter.  Most fights end too quickly in the same slow-motion final attack.

* There aren't really many interesting weapons/gadgets or upgrades.  It's pretty limited what Batman can employ during fights.

* There is very little indication of where to go, even with a map and an indicator.

* Useless map = frustration.  Many times you're told ""go clear over there to this green indicator"".  The map makes the path between look pretty straight forward.  Unfortunately the map is entirely 2D and makes no attempt to express that certain areas are on top or below the area you're standing in.  So you literally have no idea how to get somewhere.

* Scanning objects in ""detective mode"" is really buggy.  Many times I'd have to reboot the game to make an unscanned area pop up to allow me to progress forward.  Unfortunately before actually figuring out I'm in the right place and I just need to scan it, I paced around back and forth looking for where to go.  Not great.  One area even trapped Batman into an infinite fall animation once I activated detective mode.  I had to restart the game and just avoid the area, luckily it was a non-story add-on item.

* Very few and far between combat sequences, limited to a max of maybe 8 bad guys at a time.  The fighting sequences pop up way too seldom for it to be called an Arkham game to me.

* Limited combat modes, and very clunky unresponsive controls

* The story is pretty weak, and very predictable, except how uneventful the ending is.

CONCLUSION:
Clearly I found many issues with the title.  I forced myself to finish it for completion sake, however I was eager to be done and move on to better more interesting titles.

*Sigh* Where to begin...

This game could be better named:
""Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base"".

Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).

PLEASE, READ ON...

In the beginning...
This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the ""Star Wars"" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any ""Smuggler"" in the game for their opinion.

They strung us along and led us to believe that the ""fixes"" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an ""Expansion Pack"" to sell us! And then once again ""promised us"" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, ""just hang on, this game is going to be great!"" They promised us that they were going to do this ""Combat Upgrade"" and do it right, and it ""wouldn't be released until it's ready!""

We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...

Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited ""CU"" would be coming out along with the ""Rage of the Wookiees"" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the ""CU"" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...

They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could ""streamline"" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!

The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?

The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or ""EverStar Galaxies QuestWars"" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.

As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.

This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.

Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!

SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.

Online gamers vary from really helpful (giving advice, etc) to complete sink plungers who aren't helpful, but this is the case for most games on the net.

The game can be quite frustrating at times (being killed by a butterfly, long dull tasks, etc), however, the game was enjoyable enough to warrant a monthly fee.

However, the revamp on November 15 (or around that time) has made the game unplayable (literally).

Before, the game lagged slightly in places (crowded environments) but was bearable. Now, the player angle has changed so it is half-third person and half-first person (not that I minded too much) but now the game is unplayable in that it not only jerks but resembles a slow slideshow. I have a Geforce 5200 fx (patched up-to-date), AMD 64 3200+, a gig of ram. Not the best PC on offer but it can play all my other online games really well. I am still in the same galaxy, but now, since the 'revamp' it has made the game sour (I can't even play it long enough to know what else has changed).

Maybe I am a one-off and other people have no problems. But, if you are not too sure, download the 10 day free trial (a sure sign by developers and producers that things are not going well) and see for yourself. If you like it, buy it and enjoy it.

No damage, wasn't dropped or mishandled, it just decided one day it wasn't going to turn on anymore. I understand that everything has a shelf like, but under a year? That's awful. So I've got to revoke my original score and everything written below.

This wired controller is designed for the Xbox, and yes, I tested it on mine, but we'll get to that later. Instead, I wanted to focus for a moment on how well it works for PC.

The answer is: pretty darn good. If a PC game is ready for gamepads out of the ""box"" then this is totally plug and play. Because it's designed to mimic the Xbox controller, and since the Xbox controller is now effectively the default gamepad for PC gaming, it's totally seamless. Most of your modern games with gamepad support will recognize it right away.

The cord is a whopping 10' long -- awesome! -- which means it's a fine choice even for those with a Steamlink or other living room setup.

And yeah, I like wired controllers, so that's not an issue for me.

On Xbox, the experience is as you'd expect: seamless. It has all the standard features, including mic/headphones jack, analog sticks, and some programmable functions. You can control the mic/phones volume from the controller, which is a decent touch.

This is STURDY, too. It's a bit heavier than standard Xbox One controllers, which in my opinion is a good thing. I like a bit of weight to my controllers.

I'd complain about price, but that's most because I'm getting old and in my head controllers should still be $20-$30. We're way past that, though. This is the standard price now. So ...

The game tries to be a hybrid between a true MMO with quests and character development, on the one hand, and a driving game, on the other, and fails as a direct result of that.  Most MMO players are not into car driving games (and do not want the 100% twitch-based game and repeptitive blowing up of things), and most car driving game players are not into MMOs (and want to play offline, not worry about character development and crafting, and not pay a fee to play).  So the end result was an interesting idea and experiment, but in the end only serves to reinforce the realities that (1) in MMOs, fantasy is king, and veering outside that space is risky (even most sci-fi MMOs have failed, the notable exception being EVE Online, which has no meaningful competition in its own niche of space-based PvP game) and (2) twitch-game players do not like MMOs where they have to play a lot to advance characters and craft and so forth over the long haul, and pay a fee for the privilege to do so, and instead prefer fast-paced, action-based games that can be ""beaten"" relatively quickly over the course of a few weeks (or faster) and then mastered for a bit and on to the next game.  Trying to marry these two ideas was interesting, but failed because of a gross misinterpretation of the MMO marketplace.

It seems that EA is single minded in their plan to make PC gaming a 'pay to play' experience. This isn't about curbing piracy; Securom 7x is a complete and utter failure at that. Every game that comes with it has been immediately cracked after it's release. Securom only hurts each of us, the honest, paying customers.

What Securom does do is very, very frightening:

1. Installs a program on your computer that has ring 0 (higher than administrator) privileges to your system. This can be used to data mine, or be a door wide open to computer viruses (likely created by the exact same people who cracked the DRM in the first place!) or jeopardize your system by creating hardware or software conflicts. There's no end to what it can do. The really awful thing is that is is very, very hard to uninstall. Think uninstalling the game will get rid of it? Think again. Only a very detailed and tech skill intensive process can completely remove it. Unless editing your computer registry is something your very comfortable with, it is NOT easy.

2. Gives EA control over when and how often you can install the game. Requires your computer to 'phone home' to the EA authentication server each time you want to install. If EA ever decides that they're done supporting that server and you want to install, well guess what? You're SOL.

3. Stomps all over your consumer rights. You think you own that game you just bought? Nope. You just own the right to play it for as long as EA thinks you should, and only install it as many times as they want you to. Like renting movies? Well get used to it if you want to play EA games, because from now on, and with every Securom 7x game in the future, that is what you will be doing. Renting.

Securom 7x is just about the worst thing to ever happen to gaming. EA are morons, and better start listening to their core audience of gamers. they've all ready taken a massive hit in stock price after the epic failure that was the Spore release.

So what can you or I do about this? The answer is simple. Don't buy anything from EA until they get rid of Securom 7x once and for all. I won't be buying this game, or Crysis Warhead, or Dead Space, or any number of other games that I otherwise would because I refuse to let EA treat me like a criminal.

btw this is the hardest screen protector to remove once placed that ive ever seen, i literally cut underneath my fingernail trying to remove it..so if you do get it on and don't like it have fun risking ruining your system + injuring yourself. also it leaves adhesive all over your console when you remove it, so have fun scrubbing it off with spit and a lint cloth.

My quest is: Do you want to suffer through the first couple hours of a game before it 'gets better,' or do you want to play something that is fun from the start?  Personally, I would rather play something fun.  Even those games which are complicated and take a while to get into tend to be at least enjoyable from the start.  If a game takes time to get into there needs to be an incentive to keep playing until it does.  With Two Worlds I spent that time staring at my television in dumb shock that something quite this bad had managed to be released in the first place... let alone get a special edition.

Horrible control, frequent hitches and freezes, terrible music and voice acting, unreadable fonts and menus you have to squint to see no matter how nice your television are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problem with this game.  (Imagine you can't read the description for your new piece of armor because instructions telling you to press the back button for instructions to navigate the menu are obscuring half of it.  Are you going keep a game with a problem like that?)  I spent as much time frozen as I did playing the game and this was on a new 360 which has never frozen or even glitched momentarily before and still plays all other games perfectly.

Like many others, I purchased this because I was curious.  I saw bad reviews and knew that I often liked games with 'mixed reviews.'  The major review sites have, for the most part, said the game is good.  (I really do wonder if they are playing the same thing.)  I did not want and was not expecting Oblivion.  That is why I am writing this now.  Do not buy this game.  If you simply must try it, PLEASE find some way to rent it first.  Also, if you played the PC version and liked it okay, please get the PC version.  It is better than the 360 one, which is abysmal.  I tried to enjoy this game, I kept putting it back in the 360 hoping I could squeeze an itty bitty amount of fun out of my special edition.  Alas, it was impossible.

If only I had never opened the box so I could get my money back.  I would feel guilty reselling it.  (If nothing else I have said has convinced you not to buy the game!)  Admittedly, this has some of the best extras I've seen in a special edition in a long time.

The controls are horribly clunky, the melee attack is more powerful than bullets(but at least you have forearms the size of Buicks), a cutscene every 2 seconds, you get the world's wimpiest gun on a mission against zombies and megazombies and they have successfully created the world's most idiotic and annoying assistant.

In light of that, I will give this game a fair two part review, but I had to give it one star to make up for the fan boy inflation. This game is undeserving of 3.5 stars. 2 is realistic and that's only because a semi-dark toned campaign saved it from a one.

The single player. Good controls, no real bugs or issues. The story is ok, very predictable. They did a great job with casting Kevin spacey, the rest of the characters I could care less for. You can run through it in about 6 hours and it's semi-enjoyable. The problem is, it's so repetitive. Is no one else tired of tapping x to do some stupid sequence? Or following the character around, but the character is walking too slow? The jets controls are also awful, battle field definitely has that on lock down. Running around in beast mode with the Eco suit is cool. Like I said earlier, this campaign is nothing new, but it's this game's saving grace.

The multiplayer...I mean what can I say? Ever since CoD4 it has been eroding. Same old engine, same crappy graphics. What I mean by crappy graphics is that they have the same stupid guns, just with different names and skins. The lag compensation is still there, so if you have fiber optics or stable internet you're punished. Shooting half a round into someone will result in your death. The maps are pretty bad. Not entirely bad, the majority of them are awful. If you're a sniper don't even try unless your whole team is guarding you. If you like shotguns you better get sneaky if you move around because there's a 5 year old camping in every corner worried about his k/d. I played through one prestige and found it the most frustrating cod ever because of the lag compensation. (Anything but an assault rifle on core and you probably won't do well) they have three studios churning these out yearly so they can make a quick Q4 billion.

At least initially. It eventually says it is a gamepad, but it functions like a modified keyboard. It doesn't have any of the standard key mapping so even software that supports gamepads need to be remapped. The arrow keys are, for example, WASD by default, which are typical keyboard movement commands, but who in their right mind wants to use the arrows to move when there is a joystick? The shoulder buttons are a mystery. L1 doesn't do anything so I can't map anything to it, while L2 prints a 7 on the screen. R1 also doesn't do anything, but R2 prints 8. What's the point of the extra buttons? The left joy stick, by default, corresponds to the arrow keys.

To be clear, there is a very big difference between ""0"" and ""joystick button 0"" which is what games actually look for. Since it doesn't display itself properly to the operating system and does not include a way to change the mapping internally it severely limits it's functionality.

In the few cases where I got it to work I loved it. The size is good and it charges well, although it uses the now depreciated mini USB rather than the micro USB that most other devices use so it can be a bit of a bother on that front as well. mini USB has been depreciated for nearly a decade now so that tells you something right there.

UPDATE: There is NO ""mode"" switching feature! Pressing mode in Windows 10 turns it on. Pressing Mode+A in Windows causes it to blink rapidly where after pairing and unpairing it stops blinking but does the EXACT same thing. The ""mode"" button is nothing more than a fancy on button.

1.0,True,"09 30, 2009",A21E418UTTLZB4,B001RNOQLS,J. Worosylo,"I bought this controller for Killzone 2 and liked it well enough.  Coming from the ergo-awesome 360 controller, I needed something a little less wrist twisting than the DS3.  For the 10 or so hours I used the controller, it seemed quite nice.  However, something happened.

For whatever reason, my controller started vibrating without any input.  I tried to reset the controller, but it continued to vibrate.  I even let the batter completely wear down for a good week and still, when I charged it back up, it started vibrating again.

Normally, I wouldn't worry about it since this type of issue should be covered under a warranty.  However, as soon as I contacted customer service at DreamGear, I was played like a fiddle.

Not only do they not stand behind their products, but the inner-most workings of this thing must be quite sub-par for it to just start vibrating for no reason and THEN not be able to remedy it.

In summary, the controller design is nice.  However, whats the point of a controller if it doesn't work and if the manufacturer doesn't support their products.  DreamGear has failed in my eyes and I hope no one else makes the mistake of buying their less-than-worthless products.","Decent Design, Failed Implementation, Disgusting Customer Service",1254268800,58,,

This review focuses on the one item exclusive to the Survival Edition, the PipBoy Clock. The clock is a poor product, plain and simple, and not worth $10 extra, much less the $50 over the Collector's Edition price.

Performance is terrible. The clock doesn't work unless you use some redneck engineering on it with aluminum foil inserts placed between the positive battery point and the positive contact plate. Once you get the batteries in and actually get power to the display, setting the time can itself is cumbersome. The three buttons provided are often times unresponsive, requiring a good deal of wiggling at times to get the display to change as desired. The display, even with fresh batteries, is very dim, very hard to interpret unless the room it's in is very dark.

In terms of power consumption, it devours batteries, consuming three AA batteries every two weeks, sometimes sooner. In comparison, the old one-way pager I carry for my job, which has an alarm, storage for phone numbers and time received, and makes some rudimentary sounds if desired, uses one AAA battery every MONTH or so. This clock doesn't even have an alarm, and uses much more power for it.

Aesthetically, the clock is a mixed bag. The overall design and look match the Fallout universe exactly. My example, however, arrived unpainted, looking nothing like I expected it to look. I know the technology and ""look and feel"" of the game series is ""used retro science fiction"", but this clock is as drab as drab gets, with no logos or anything to maintain that sense of having something form the Fallout world, even if it's a fake. Further, the clock was at one point supposed to be wearable like the PipBoy used in the game. That too, has been nullified by poor craftsmanship.

Furthermore, the level of customer service provided for this clock from amazon.com and Bethesda SoftWorks, the game's license holder, is incredibly underwhelming. For one, in order to get any warranty work done on it, you must send in money, and the clock, to some company in California that no one's ever heard of. So for yet more money you lose possession of a broken clock that originally only cost you $50. Compare this sort of ""service"" to the defective&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gears-of-War-2-Amazon-com-Exclusive-Lancer/dp/B001CLYL24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gears of War 2 Amazon.com Exclusive Lancer</a>. When the NECA Lancer had its own battery issue, similar to the one described above, NECA and amazon.com worked to fix it somehow. NECA sent out replacement parts, for free, in a timely manner if you contacted them. amazon.com handed out $10 coupons good for the next purchase on ANYTHING they sell. Wither that level of customer service from amazon.com and Bethesda SoftWorks for this quasi-defective clock?

All in all, SAVE YOUR MONEY. The Collectors' Edition gives you so much more value, with the lunchbox and bobblehead being the best collectibles this year. With incredibly poor workmanship, lack of attention to detail, unknown warranty service from a company whose reliability can't be ascertained, and overall price point, this clock simply is not worth the extra $50 price.",Shoddy Clock Not Worth Price,1228176000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

6th time was not a charm. It is still a piece of crap. It just turns off for no reason and sometimes the sound cuts out and you have to turn off the controller and turn it back on for it to recognize the headset again.

Why can they not make a decent controller? The Xbox 360 controllers were way better.

I was one of them. But RE6 is so jaw-droppingly, nail-shreddingly, absolutely, abysmally awful that you'll long for the days of RE5 and look back on them with fond memories. I've played many bad games in my life, but none made me as unhappy as this. RE6 will fill you with anger and rage under so much pressure you'll want to rip your TV from its mount on the wall and throw it through the window. How on Earth any of the trash that is featured in this game got approved by anyone at Capcom is beyond my understanding and I'm a man of noble intelligence.

RE6 just doesn't know what it is or what it wants to be. It's horribly bad but it's not a horror. Huge chunks of the game feel like any other generic war game (of which there are numerous) with generic monster enemies. Honestly, this thing may have been innovative and horrifying back when video games first featured genetically engineered mutations but it's completely by-the-numbers now. There are 4 different campaigns, all showing a different angle on the same world-wide catastrophe, all with different formulas relating to the series past. This just doesn't work. It might have been somewhat bearable if the game had a recognizable objective or mystery but it's just ""go forward and shoot"" while the levels go on and on and on and on and on and on and on...and DOES IT EVER END???

There is a boss in this game called Simmons. I swear the fight never stops. You'll experience boredom, tedium, and frustrations the likes of which a video game has never made you feel before. There's no satisfaction to this. The game makes a fool of you and takes time out of your precious and finite lifespan for the pleasure. The gameplay is slow, confusing, badly programmed, and joyless with cumbersome characters that control like they are drunk, and an epileptic, schizophrenic camera that will not let you orient yourself.

The story is just an incomprehensible mess. You'll give up on it after five minutes, and then when you try to skip through the cut-scenes and action-breaks you'll realize, to your immense disappointment (a feeling that this game will constantly provoke from you) that you can't. Yup, be prepared to spend ages and ages and ages being force-fed this garbage because you can't jump past it and continue with your tedious quest of killing monsters, or zombies, or whatever they are supposed to be. I honestly don't care.

Resident Evil is finished. Believe me, there is utterly nowhere the series can go now. The existence of this trash has killed the franchise. If there were an RE7, no matter how good it could be, it would not make the series recover or the fanbase forgive Capcom. It's just so unbelievably bad that I actually don't like myself for playing it for so long, hoping that it might get better. I should have known how to spot a stinker and RE6 proves itself to be exactly that in the first 5 minutes.

Do no, under any circumstances, subject yourself to this kick in the balls. It's just not worth it. Go outside, get fresh air, plant a tree, meet people.

More horrible is the thought that ""Aliens"" is thee biggest influance of pass and current titles from other movies to book and video games; Doom, Halo, StarCraft even Dead Space all take inspiration from that second film.

Waking up on release day I first checked IGN to see what they had to say about Aliens: Colonial Marines. A rating of 4. Bad.  That was their official review.

- Voice-overs: excellent voice-acting, especially Hawke, who is one smooth cat.

- Script: Bioware's dialogue and writing is still among the best in the industry (script does not make the story).

- Skills: The revamped skill trees add a lot more diversity to your chosen class (rogue, mage, warrior).

CONS:
- RPG mechanics: practically non-existent or not in sync with established norms. A perfect example is how a dual-wielding rogue dishes out more damage than a double-handed axe-wielding warrior (huh?).

- Story: non-existent 'main story.' Its actually a hodge-podge of side quests - most of which are so ill-structured that one has to wonder how they had the balls to charge $59.99. The quest structure is too simplified and like the rest of the game, utterly boring. And then there are the filler quests. All of them have you stumble upon a random item (e.g. someone's hat) and turn it into a random, characterless person (e.g. a monk) with nothing more than a 'this looks like it belongs to you.' Ridiculous. Had this game come out for a mobile device or an ipad, it would have been great (but also, not on my radar). Angry Birds on my Android provides much better entertainment than this stinking mess.

- World: The biggest disappointment is the use of the same areas ad nauseum ad infinitum. I practically quit playing the game for more than a week after entering the Wounded Coast for what felt like the 100th time. This is shameful when considering the fact that it took me about 70 hours over a period of 10 days to finish the original game.

NEUTRAL:
- Combat: Its fun at first, but glaringly different from Origins. I did like the old system better. This one's just got too much blood everywhere - and the most shameless use of repeated death animations ever. Hit someone with a mighty blow and the dude/dudette explodes in a shower of gibblets. What's more, females undergo a sex-change in the instant before death and land in a heap of distnictly male body parts. Yes Bioware, I can spot that bald head and those bulging forearms.

- Music: Not bad, but not particularly memorable. A few recycled tracks from the first game - which both hurts and benefits the game. Truly neutral on this point.

OTHER THOUGHTS:
Accoridng to Steam I have spent a total of 364 hours on Origins and another 30-something on Awakening. Rest assured that'll never happen with DA2. Providing actual entertainment was clearly the lowest item on the developer's priority list. Where Origins was a work of love and a proper homage to the Baldur's Gate series, DA2 is simply the result of EA pressing Bioware for a quick profit. DA2 is to Origins what Justin Bieber is to Pink Floyd. I'm not buying anything from Bioware that's got Mike Laidlaw at the helm (Sorry to single you out Mike, but if this ship's going down I'm holding the captain responsible).

***GRAPHICS -

Beautifully done. That is all the good I can say about this game.

***GAME PLAY -

BARELY PLAYABLE!! Totally stinks. This game was converted over (PORTED) from a console like the PS2. For the uninformed, this means the developers wanted to go cheap by taking a game DESIGNED for the PS2, save a buck and make crude changes to the code to make in playable on a PC. PLAYABLE is the operative word. This game is BARELY PLAYABLE! Tons of bugs! Cut scenes that don't work or run all the time. Suspicion/Tension levels that won't drop off no matter how good you did the job or how far away you are from the scene. Guys that won't die when shot. Guards that just 'appear' from thin air. The list goes on.

***POINTLESS GAME OPTIONS -

You get a small choice of weapons but basically, every mission will only require your silenced ""baller"" pistol. If you use the other heavy weapons, you can get the job done...but the damage will be so great that you will lose money paying for damages and to quiet witnesses. I did the entire game using only syringe and  the garrote.

*** BUGS -

1.0,False,"09 7, 2008",A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B001AYEGXM,NeuroSplicer,"The game has been just released. But I am not going to buy it. I used to a have a standing pre-order but not anymore, that has been long canceled. I gave EA a chance to mend its ways but it failed. Here is why.

This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7x with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.

Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.

LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions ""on 3 different computers"" but avoids to clarify what a ""different computer"" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.

Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.

Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?
Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?
Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?
According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...

Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?

In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?
And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?

So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?

Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!

The only fun I found was driving the cars, escaping the cops, etc.  Look, I am a 64 y.o. man, and if Mafia II bores me, I'm guessing you won't be happy either.  Now I'll give you the benefit of doubt, it could be because I am really into high action games--you know, something that makes my heart pump; and at my age, you must understand,  that is important.  How else would I know I'm still alive?

Mafia II has the look and feel of games that hit the market ten years ago.  The graphics, while they are acceptable, respond to the controller with too much jerking...character movement lacked smoothness...very edgy.  If you are a person that likes slow-moving games requiring only minimal cognitive ability, well, all I can say is enjoy.

Maybe there is something in the game I am not seeing.  Maybe I should have tried to achieve higher levels before giving up on it...but geeze, when, oh when was this game going to give me a real challenge?  Granted, I suppose my criticisms may have spawned from too much Call of Duty, Halo, and naturally, being a pilot myself, games like Namco's ""Ace Combat 6"" - Hey, how about Pac Man?  Now there was a game that torqued my jaws....<GRIN>  Talk about Tension!  (You've got to know, I'm kidding.)

Mafia II may have debuted about four years ago (which makes me wonder why they were pushing sales on it this year), but you can't help but wonder if they pulled it out of a late '90s storage closet.  For me, it's just hard to imagine this game was developed in the 21st century.

Bottom line:  If you're ready to get into this game, make sure you slam down an energy drink before you begin--because at that moment when there is some action, you'll be able to wake up and jump into it, otherwise.... <YAWN>  As I understand it, there are those who truly believe and insist there is action in Mafia II...who knows, maybe I slept through it.

The ending of Wind Waker was LEGENDARY! I yawned once I finished Twilight Princess.

Listen, this game had a wonderfull beginning. I liked the cutscenes and the first time I transformed into a wolf I was in awe. But then I hated how weak and rushed the plot became. Why the hell did those orcs just drop the kids somewhere? And around the time Ilia got her memory back the plot fizzled completely. Also the plot in this game was too little about Triforce, history, the world/land of Hyrule etc. They were touched really superficially.
The plot and dialogue were *extremely inferior* compared to Wind Waker.
Twilight Princess was boring, choppy and jumpy after a great beginning.

And the dungeons. Something was severely lacking. In the beginning they were ok, though nothing great, but then they got horrible. Like the City in the Sky and Twilight Realm. Horrible.
I guess they went for quantity not quality. The dungeons were boring and repetitive, the puzzles old and they lacked any atmosphere.
Also if I remember correctly in Wind Waker you had to use many of the items you had acquired in different places. Not here.

This game was also *WAY too easy*. I'm not a good player, honestly, but I never once died during the game. As a matter of fact I was near perfect health nearly all the time. Once you got the Master Sword you just needed to swing the nunchuk and the enemies would vanish. I mean I'd want standard enemies that would be at least as tough as Ganon was in the final swordfight.
The bosses were also very easy and somehow lamer than in Wind Waker.

I liked the Wii controls and they were well planned and easy to use. But I have one complaint. Circling behind an enemy's back really didn't work that well. First you had to sidestep and then roll. But guess what, most of the time the roll (+sidestep) brought you around the enemy to where you started. It was irritating (though not by any means impossible) to hit the enemies in the back.

Oh, and why did most of the characters have to look so retarded? They showed with some models that they could make neat looking ones as well...

Riding on the horse was the greatest part of this game!
You should really buy Wind Waker instead of this. People complain about the graphics but they're quite nice once you get used to them. And did I mention that the dialogue and plot are awesome.

The game is stable enough (probably cause its been out for quite a while) but they forget to tell you what to do at multiple points, so you have to quit and google it.  For example, at one point you have to use your batclaw to pull a stupid raft along a canal, but once you latch onto something, there's no way to release your batclaw because they didn't program a prompt to tell you you have to crouch to release it, so you can launch your batclaw at something else to pull your raft by pounding the spacebar 100 times.  THis kind of crap happens again and again, making the game practically unplayable.  Then some of the bosses are damn near impossible to beat, like Deathstroke.

First off, it seems to need the maximum end of the living room size range. Even with one player I had to stand over 8 feet from the sensor. I nearly returned the Kinect because of this. I just don't have much more room than that in my play area and the box clearly shows 6 feet being OK.
Next, the game is just too slow to respond to movements. The handball game is WAY too slow, you have to hit the balls when they're half way down the court for them to track properly. The game where you dodge obstacles while on a raft track requires an irresponsible amount of side to side movement in a ridiculously short amount of time. Even my very athletic stepson couldn't keep up with it without running into walls and tripping and falling into the fireplace. Even when you do it right, it doesn't register your movement, so you have to jump twice as far and twice as high and do everything to the extreme.
If you're the average somewhat soft American and were thinking about buying a Kinect to be a little more active, don't. This game might kill you. ""Jocks"" only. I had very low expectations for the Kinect technology, and this game hits my expectations right on the head. It barely works and needs a massive living room area.
It does however, come with the demo for Joy Ride, which we enjoyed a bit more. It didn't require nearly as many extreme motions, but all the same, it still didn't feel quite as responsive as I'd like a game control to feel.","Nice tech demo, needs polish.",1307145600,3,,

My step brother likes shooters and fighting games, so I went and rented this.  I am happy it was a rental.  I had never seen the Watchmen movie,  though I rented it with the game.  At first I said I liked the game.  It seemed fun enough.  You run around and fight off the evil baddies.  That was all fine and good.  Then I realized that was about all I would be doing.  You run around and fight enemies over and over and over again.

While one of the characters can run, the other kind of walks or wobbles, as if he has to go to the bathroom.  Sometimes, the controls seem to just stop.  It was as if I were stuck behind an invisible wall.  The combat is very minimal.  Meaning you just hit the buttons and the enemies will eventually go down.  If I were a science guy, I would have a monkey play and beat the game in hours.  Seriously folks, it's that easy.  So if you like button mashers, you may, MAY enjoy this game.  I would say rent it.

Then, the voice acting.  Wow, it's really bad.  I mean, maybe its part of the movie or something.  Shady guys that talk strange in a costume.  But if not, they could have at least hired people who could do at least a good line every now and then.  I mean it was so ridiculously bad, that it made me laugh over and over again.  It made me forget that I was playing a game that was meant to be serious.

Now, as I said the game is very easy.  But, they have parts that are ridiculously, annoyingly hard.  My step brother and I were getting through really fast.  Then came the darn lock.  Let me tell you, picking the dang lock was crazy.  We both tried for like 10 minutes.  Then it was time for dinner, so we went up and ate.  Then we came down and tried for about 20 minutes.  It was annoying.  Every time you would have like all but two picked, you would accidently hit the button and the freaking thing would make you start all over.  We never got it unlocked.  I remembered that I had Call of Duty World at War.  So we played that.  I was just playing it again, by myself.  My step bro and sis went home.  It was even more annoying this time.  I couldn't even play enough to get to the lock pick.  It was just annoying.

For those that liked the movie and, or, like button mashers, I would say rent this before you buy it.

1.0,True,"05 10, 2011",ARTRFSZQPWY9I,B002DC8GKE,Ian B. Cooper,"Got Brink yesterday. This is an update to my earlier review. All I can say is, this is one frustrating game!

Firstly, the deep storyline I was looking forward to - all that potentially rich back-story that was hinted at in the pre-release videos and advertising... well it's not there. We get a couple of sentences from a disembodied voice telling how the Ark was a self-sustaining green vision of the future - and that's it! You don't even get a feeling for which side you identify with more, before the game forces you to choose a side. Talk about lost potential!

Then you get to customize your character. This is actually kinda fun (though weirdly laggy). Still, there are some very nice, unusual-looking characters with some great artwork. Then again, my daughter feels left out because there are no women characters available.

Then you go to the missions. This is not handled in a smooth way at all. If you choose to save the Ark you just choose a mission and you get a cut scene with a guy almost incomprehensible generic African accent babbling on about terrorists. Yes, it's the tired old 'terrorists have kidnapped someone, stolen a data chip, etc.', formula that we've seen in all the worst post-9/11 games.

Then comes combat.

I haven't seen a shooter with combat this bad since... Actually I've NEVER seen combat this bad. It's basically like an arcade 'duck hunt' game with targets that move around as if they're on some sort of futuristic speed-type drug. And you have to pump a clip or two into them in order to take them down. Meanwhile, even on easy difficulty you get killed if you get shot with a few rounds - and the AI have perfect aim. True, sometimes they're too stupid to even shoot at you at all, but when there are ten of them spawning around you, you haven't much hope.

I played on easy difficulty. I don't know anyone who can beat the missions on this game, but I know I can't. Easy difficulty is not supposed to pose a challenge! It's supposed to be easy - that's why it's called 'easy'. When you're developing a game, the difficulty levels are not there for the elite players - they'll choose 'super hard' every time. The rest of us need options that make it easier on us. Starting at 'impossible to do on your first five tries' is not 'easy'. I don't know why so many developers don't get this.

When you respawn (which you do a LOT), there's no option to respawn at a newly-captured station - you have to go all the way back to the start. So you end up spending a lot of time incapacitated, then you spend a long time running back to the action, then you get about two seconds of shooting (because the game's choke points are suicide). Then it's rinse and repeat.

The cut scenes seem tacked-on. None of them flow into or from the combat like other modern games' cut scenes do. So you get a jarring feel which make me suspect that the game just wasn't finished. I'd say this game needed another six months of development before it was ready for release. The developers have the kernel of a good game here, but it's not polished - heck, it's not even ready to be polished. This is a 'pre-alpha' version of the game Brink could have - should have - been.

This is in all ways a 1990s style shooter. None of the last decade's improvements are in this game - no cover, no CoD-style aim assist etc. - it's just run, shoot, respawn. Single player is incredibly frustrating and disorienting - and it only lasts a long time because the missions are almost unbeatable even on easy difficulty. Finishing a mission is virtually impossible in single player.

The smooth movement that was advertised is haphazard to say the least - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Assassin's Creed does it right - this game, not so much.

The only good thing about this game is the character generation.

I've given this game a fair try. This one is going back to Amazon - assuming they accept opened games. I hate to say this, but it's basically a great character customization game with a Starsiege-Tribes-era FPS tacked on.

Update 11-9-2015
It has been about 6 weeks since my review and I learned weeks ago about the reset issue but didn't think about posting it until now.
If you are playing Pro Clubs and the captain jumps out of the lobby, it resets your player.

 I have noticed that every time the captain leaves I drop from an 89 CAM to an 81 CAM. You just have to back out and it will restore your rating, but if you don't notice it and stay in the lobby and play the next game, it will save your game as the reset player and you have to start all over again. I have known this for a month or so now and EA still has not fixed it.

I think maybe it is just that people don't spend half their paycheck buying packs for Pro Clubs  like they do in Ultimate team so they don't make a sh*t load of money so they don't really care.

This game is SO terrible.

There is NO manual, or tutorial.
When you mouse-over something it never gives you a pop-up window for info.
You just have to guess what all the buttons and icons mean.
The Idea is great. I was hoping that (this being the 4th in the series) that it would be the latest and greatest.
NOPE.
The guards look like prisoners. Too much like the prisoners. There is no easy way of finding them. In all the other TYCOON games you can turn on/off
layers of things (ie. trees, buildings, guests, etc). Clicking on a character only works once in about 8 clicks. Normally, you end up selecting the building they are standing near.

When a guy is mad, they never tell you why. In all the other TYCOON games they have thought bubbles (ie. ""tiger is sad, and wants a mate."", ""Joe is upset there are no fast rides"", ""betty feels the park is dirty"", etc)

You have to assign guards a path to walk, or they will sit on the bleachers with the Cons all day. In Roller Coaster Tycoon, you can assign workers AREAS to maintain. The guards will also do nothing unless you click them, and tell them to beat a prisoner. I have three guards, and a councilor sitting on the bleachers, right now, watching an inmate get killed less then three feet away.
Oh.. that reminds me... you can not remove the dead. I'm not sure how to, anyway. I have dead bodies laying all around my prison. The guards have no ""remove corpse"" Icon, and neither do the janitors.
The dogs seem to be the only proactive guards in the prison. They walk around, attack fighting prisoners, and take care of themselves.
good boy.
When you find there are more prisoners then beds, you have to open the prisoners list, and click each of 50+ prisoners names, to find which one has no Bed Icon that pops up on one of the Housing Dorms. That is the only way to find out who is bed-less.
My Prisoners dug a hole. The alarm goes off. Its very loud. And they tell me to fill in the hole. After searching forever, i find it. It is UNDER another object. One of the buildings has these pillars that stick out in front, and the hole was on the same location as the pillar. I click a guard (about 9 times), then run the cursor over the hole, and click..... AHHH! It clicked the prisoner escaping, and selected HIM. I have to go and try an click the guard again. Then ... wait for the prisoner to escape... then click the hole... DAMN! I clicked the pillar, and I get the building edit screen... grrrrr..... Get the Guard selected again, and try to click the hole.... WORKED. He runs over to the hole... then STOPS. IT's time for his coffee break, so he turns around and walks toward the bunk-house! You would think stopping prisoners from escaping would over-ride his break time....
They must be UNION Guards.
....... to fill that damn hole took about 15 minutes of clicking, and re-clicking.

I really, really wanted to like this title... but.. come on! After the first gameplay - which didn't hook me, I said myself: Tonight I'm going to play it carefully, no rush, enjoying it, etc... So, I've spent a whole night just to find that I was really forcing me to play it.

DIRECT OPINION: Unpolished and unfinished!

EXPLAINED OPINION (IMO):

- GRAPHICS 5/10: They are very - I mean VERY limited. Graphics are not a must for a good game, but TSW is strangely bad.... poor quality and awful FPS... Nowadays I'm used to run many other mmo's and single-player games with much more quality and smoother, like GW2, Far Cry 3, Sleeping Dogs, BF3 and Skyrim (fully and astonish enb series modded);

- ANIMATION/MOVEMENT 3/10: TSW seems like an unfinished work on that issue. 10 year old games are still better. Oddly enough, since Age of Conan handle this pretty well. Actually I bought it because of AOC also, expecting something close... What a surprise then... a bad one; You aim in one direction and can shoot something like 60 degrees aside!; You step in the roof of a car, and your arms points straight ahead when you are shooting zombies below you... zombies rush at your like they're using rollerblades; Overall, it recalls me a ""stick-man"" animation, or maybe Pitfall;

- SOUNDS 3/10: I'd like to say something better here.. but at a time, I thought my sound was muted or unbalanced, unstable.. but no... it is the way it goes. Sometimes you barely hear your footsteps, then an explosion take place totally unbalanced, or a scream... something like that;

- GAMEPLAY 3/10: If I haven't play anything else in the last 5 years, maybe I had not notice that... thing is: some elements are broken, missing, simply wrong... examples:
 - zombies spawns in a totally strange order and out of nowhere;
 - too many repetitive mobs; too many;
 - you can't simply walk around in some places, due to the awful - awful mobs placement! Feels like devs just decided the amount of enemies and dropped them around without minimum criteria;
 - you try to clear a couple of zombies to get a boss and voil: before finish them, they respawn just like a brand new ones. See that first city quests to know what I'm talking about; It's annoying as hell;
 - Fireguns have unlimited ammo;
 - Bad UI: you open a dialog box and pressing ESC doesn't close it... just shows seetings in foreground. You have to aim exactly in the right spot to close it. Otherwise you'll accept the quest by mistake; Dialog boxes open zoomed, if your cam is close. You must open it, and then adjust zoom in order to read it...
 - Waaay to long loading times. Even if you're reloading the same map over and over again;
 - That life-tree-thing... awful movement and directions. You can fall by accident in the edges and guess what? More loading times after several seconds falling. Just to respawn in the beginning;

- SKILLS 7/10: Here is the point that made me persist a bit more... but nothing to catch me in front of so many ""if only..."" or ""I wish..."";

The same way to the PS3 will never measure up to the PS2, the Vita is milestones away from its predecessor. The most powerful systems have never been on top through out gaming history, & history repeats itself once again. What did the PS2 have that the PS3 didn't? God-like 3rd party support! But not just that! It had the most important aspect of all, BALANCE! Power means nothing to a game console. Games mean everything. Attracting people with power instead of gameplay mechanics and games is the easy way out, & it's the route Sony is taking. On The PS2 you could get ANY type of game, literally. It had all the different genres, & the best in their respective fields. It's why the PS2 was so successful, it appealed to everyone. Western styled gamers got their fix of sports, shooting, and racing, while us Eastern inspired gamers also got our fix of jrps, strategy, & weird over-the-top japanese games.

PS2 had it all, as did the PSP. Heck the PSOne had it as well. Nintendo had me by the horns in handheld gaming til the PSP showed up. Best portable gaming system ever made. The PSP had the same support PS2 did. ANY type of game you could think of, in abundance, & top quality at that. The PS3 however instead of staying 50/50 like it's predecessor did, it went something like 85/15. Could even be worse than that. The eastern-ispired library for the PS3 is so tiny I could count it on my hands and feet. Sony has gone almost full-swing westerner, over flowing their systems with the same type of games over and over. They've realized the average westerner is narrow minded and would play the exact game over and over if it had a gun in it or followed up on sports. Western gaming ain't going very far in terms of variety, & now you have the biggest franchises over here being shooting and football games etc, with Sony putting out statements on how ""that's the market now"". It's not that the market for eastern-inspired games ain't there anymore, it's that Sony's following the money trail.

The Vita is the same thing. Compared to the PSP it fails hard. Yeah it's powerful, Sony's stuff will always be powerful, but as we can see, they won't always be the best. The Vita could rightfully be called the best portable media device ever made, but not the best portable gaming system. The good games are so few and variety is as dull as the PS3. It's a portable replica of the PS3's mistake. I had high hopes for the Vita but it let me down big time. There aren't enough good games to go around. No wonder it's jam packed with all that other non-related gaming stuff. Now as a result devs are getting lazy/sloppy knowing they can do the same things over and over and make a fortune.

The heroes remain true to type, though Splinter is not a wizened old rodent so much as he is simply wise. The CG animation design works very well for the Ninja Turtles themselves, and the show is respectful and knowing in relation to the original cartoon from the '80s. This attention to detail is followed through on with Activision's latest TMNT game, the second to hit this year (though the first based on the Nickelodeon franchise), but not where it counts. The dialogue and characterization is all spot-on, indicating a very close knowledge of the show, and there are even some gameplay elements that call out to the old arcade game, but the actual experience of playing the game is a total letdown. Instead of putting the same skill and love into the game that the show has received, this game is a cynical cash-in aimed at the children (including those at heart) who would be most interested in it.

It should come as no surprise that TMNT is yet another brawler, and as mentioned before it owes a great debt to the old TMNT arcade game, even allowing players to throw enemies at the screen, where they squeak down the frame after being flattened on the imaginary fourth wall. Unfortunately, the comparisons stop there. The graphics are very simple, even for a translation from CG animation to a game; there are obvious and glaring jagged edges everywhere. There isn't much going on to look at, either. Animations are simple and choppy, and while there may be several Turtles and foes on screen at once, it never looks very impressive.

The audio is even worse, unfortunately. The music is tinny, quiet, and repetitive, adding nothing to the game. The voice acting, while in line with the show, was recorded terribly, and often sounds clipped and distorted, displaying a shocking lack of quality control. I can't remember the last time recorded vocals sounded like they were being shouted into an old telephone before now.

If the gameplay held up its end of the bargain, the simplistic visuals and lackluster sound might be forgiven. Unfortunately, while the skeleton of a brawler is there, the muscles aren't. Nothing has any weight of impact; if it wasn't for combo counters and point pop-ups showing you've connected, you'd rarely know if you'd hit your opponents. Special moves use a fun, short cutscene, but they obscure the actual move itself, so the end result isn't very impressive. There are only a few different types of enemies, and the same strategy prevails throughout the entire game; mash X until an enemy is dazed and a yellow ""Y"" appears above their head, mash ""Y"" with a directional input, and toss the enemy. Rinse and repeat. For bosses, or a large amout of foes, hit ""B"" occasionally. The boss fights might seem more interesting at first, but since no bosses have any change to their pattern, despite multiple in-fight cutscenes, they grow tired long before they end as well.

The most disappointing aspect of this game is how well the developers obviously know the franchise; none of the game rings false when it relates to the show. Unfortunately, the game itself is all shell, no turtle, and only young fans will be able to look past the undercooked gameplay experience to enjoy what little remains. If your son, like mine, MUST play it, rent it. Play it for the four hours it takes and return it. And then add your voice to let Activision and Nickelodeon know that this franchise deserves far better than this.",A cynical shell of a game,1384819200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The graphics on #1 put the tutorial instructions off the border / side of the screen when displayed on HDTV. There is no option on the PS3 to change this. Basically, the instructions on what to do are unreadable. Maybe this could be fixed by changing to standard definition (or maybe not). The game play itself is so simplistic that the manufacturer should blush for charging in today's market. In coop mode, two players have groups of worms and take turn firing weapons. You slowly select a weapon, fire, wait for primitive graphics, and then hand over the controller. Yawn. Everything is flat-screen 2D animation from ten years ago.

Game #2 the graphics show shadows & depth, 3D not in the sense of a 3D display but rather from the modern cartoons. You play one worm at a time, and that worm can move left & right & in & out of the screen. The worm moves about the rate you'd expect of a worm--ridiculously slowly. The worm goes around picking up weapons, slowly selects one weapon, fires somewhere (typically at an enemy worm), the you wait impatiently for animations. There are funny jokes during the animation, but also a lot of just waiting for no apparent reason while the system sits there. With most weapons, every time you want to fire, you need to pull up the weapon-select menu, navigate slowly from the ""home"" position, select the weapon, then you can focus and fire. Basically there is way, way, way too much waiting and way, way, way too slow of a pace.

Not mentioned is how slow your character is.  Unless you're running, Batman strolls and turns very slowly wherever he goes.  But here is the thing I object to the most.  At the beginning of the game, your character decides to follow the guards who are slowly, incrementally escorting the Joker inside the asylum.  This routine goes through several doors and hallways.  But this 10 minute long annoyance is just to get you to read the developer credits, which slowly fade in and out in the upper right side of the screen (maybe that's why you're on the left.)  It doesn't just force you to endure the credits; you have to participate by holding the joystick forward and following the guards, because they stop and wait for you, and the credits stop rolling, if you say ""fook this"" and throw the controller.  So for the first ten minutes of the game you are supposed to immerse yourself in the self aggrandizement of the game's developers.  Stupid, boring, and presumptuous.  And since the whole game sucks too, why am I interested in who made it?  To me the credits are akin to a hall of shame.

1) Roster is still not updated. You would think with all the NBA Today features they implemented in the game, they would at least keep us updated with the current roster. Not the case. Rose is still with the Bulls, Kobe with the Lakers. But, at least we can watch last night's highlights on NBA Today, which are obviously more important than a roster update.

2) Whistle-mania. There is a whistle for everything. Next Gen sweat drops to the floor, whistle! Player coughs, whistle! Player sneezes, whistle! Driving for a lay up will automatically result in a whistle and free throws up. Get ready to set the TV to mute if you want to play the game. Because the whistles will have your ears ringing after a while.

3) LeBron 2K14. That, I think, is the right title for the game. I do not care that LeBron is unstoppable in the game, but why should others be transformed to crap. I chose the Lakers on numerous occasions, and I do not know how Kobe air balls wide open shots, but Nick Young can hit a fade away three. Kobe cannot shoot for crap in the game. Brick, after brick. All the points I scored with Kobe came from the free throw line, or lay ups. Kobe will not make one perimeter shot. LeBron 2K14 was made for LeBron.

4) Running the offense. 2K thinks it is important to keep changing the play calling. I do not know why, but they feel it makes the game ""new"". Try running a post up, and you will be prompted to select from a menu screen that shows up during play, a list of possible options, that you need to toggle between left and right, up and down, then left and right again...Seriously, 2K? You think that I'm going to keep reading all the options, while my point guard is trying to protect the ball, in order to run a simple post up play? Too confusing and impractical. I don't have fifteen seconds to select a play.

Easy of Navigation: As someone who has NO sense of direction, I will tell you now that I found the map to be offputing. It doesn't at all have the functionality needed to tell you where to find point A or B. You cannot properly mark your point of interest, which bothers me insanely. A prime example was a good karma mission that came up and I had trouble locating it. The map overall is just, too distracting, too pretty.

Functionality: I find that Bioware seems to have a better grasp more and more on how difficulty and game mechanics should be, the case is not so with Sucker Punch. It feels as though Sucker Punch either learned nothing from inFamous 2 or learned so little that it hardly mattered in the grand scheme of things. You find yourself treated to not one, but three different sets of powers, smoke, neon and video (in that order). The problem is that these are nearly identical, with only a handful of things that seperate them from one another, besides those differences that are aesthetic, that is. What I would have really prefered more then anything when playing through Second Son is a decent defense power. Dashing around is nice, but there are sometimes that I feel that I am trapped in an enclosed space, thus it becoming totally useless. Whether or not the recovery effect was in the other inFamous games is pointless, but what bothers me is that it exists. It is distracting to me, especially when I find myself being attacked from multiple sides.

Activities: From what I've ever seen, most inFamous games have activities in one way or another, some good and others bad. With this sequal, there comes activities that remove the D.U.P's control by a varied percentage. I have no real opinion, except when it comes to the stencil minigame in which you move this curser that you can barely see and use the R2 button to cover a specific surface until you alternate to another stencil and so on. Making the curser highly visible would have been prefered personally, especially since I do have bad vision. The others, I think are unimpressive, but managable at best.

Extra Content: For such an open world game, there seems little to do aside from help the innocent, be a jerk, or fight the D.U.P. The game hardly breathes, feeling as though (again), Sucker Punch didn't learn as much as I would have liked from their previous success in inFamous 2. It doesn't even bother me about the claims of Seatle being too unimpressive, but I would have liked to see options that are prevailent in games like Grand Theft Auto V and Sleeping Dogs (like changing your clothes or improving your apartment?).

Conclusion: If it comes bundled with your playstation 4, then by all means play it. For a bundled game, it isn't all bad. But I would never in my own right mind suggest to any consumer to buy it. If you must buy it, then wait it out a few months to give Sucker Punch the chance to update and patch the game.",E.T for Atari was better...,1405123200,4,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

After being a big Star craft fan for so long I was psyched about this when it came out. I bought the original Star craft (with the zerg box) on the day it came out and I beat it 3 or 4 times, played the online for awhile and got many years of enjoyment out of it.

1) You do not ever get to explore the maps, create your own strategy or play how you want in the single player campaigns. Every single player map basically tells you what to do exactly and almost how to do it, the game holds your hand the entire time and guides you everywhere and giving you a cue every time something needs to be done. The entire game is literally a giant tutorial and nothing else. I never felt like I had a chance to explore, to set up defenses, to try and use strategy or anything on my own. Like for instance when you earn the ability to get siege tanks its because you ""find"" them on a mission, I use find loosely as its unavoidable to find them and then the rest of the map is setup specifically designed to let you use the siege tanks to win and doing so otherwise just doesn't work. Or one where again you ""find"" a vehicle and have to stop these trains, well unless you use the vehicles you ""found"" against the train you won't win. Every map is staged so you have exactly what you need and every map has a specific pre-designed way of beating it. They are all exactly as small as possible so you don't wander off and do something dumb like play your way. Every single player map is like playing a game of chess where the pieces are setup for you already and the only way to win is to do things the way a diagram laid out for you says.

2) Blizzards amazing story cut scenes are designed horribly. You'd think this was gears of war in space because all the men are these giant bulked out muscled guys that have to weigh 400lbs of pure muscle with arms so big that they are bigger than my torso. I thought we would get away from the chris redfield of resident evil 5 and gears of war school of character design. This is a little gripe yes but it kind of ruins my ability to suspend disbelief when every male in the game (aside from the skinny nerdy guy) look like they are smuggling car fenders on their clothes.

3) I still dislike that I paid 60 bucks for 1/3 of a game. I know blizzard said many times that they couldn't put all of the campaigns in here due to time and so on. But I look back at Starcraft and warcraft 3 where they managed to fir great multiplayer, many single player missions for all 3 races and a complete storyline onto a single 700mb cd but they can't do it with a dvd or two now also? I don't like the idea of paying 180 dollars to play all 3 races. Now since they merged with activision this tactic or more money is becoming more evident, I don't think it has anything to do with time or whatnot. Since merging with activision their prices have gone up, starcraft 2 cost 60 when they used to cost 50 like all of pc games, the starcraft 2 collector's edition now costs 100 when it used to be blizzard only charged 60 for the collector editions, the WOW:CATA collector's edition also got its price raised by like 30 bucks. The game was chopped up into 3 parts so they could sell more and nothing else.

4) Every other mission I felt like I was being rushed as much as possible in the single player campaign. It seems like every other mission has a timer of some sort. Save the colonists before the protoss kill them, destroy the trains before 5 get away, get out before the never ending wave of zerg kill you and so on. Way to often the game is rushing you through the map.

5) Even if you don't play online, you still have to connect to your online account to play. You have to get a battle.net account, you have to register your games cdkey and you have to be connected to your battle.net account before you can play a offline single player game. I don't like having to login so I can play a game offline.

6) There is no LAN support in the game meaning if I want to play with friends we are forced to go online and get funneled through the battle.net service. I don't like that, I liked being able to get on a LAN with my friends right there and play 100% lag free with no problems. But blizzard removed that feature purely so were forced to us their battle.net service in order to keep us on their servers. So the people I play with we tried it a couple times and didn't like it, so we fired up the original Starcraft instead and played on the lan and had more fun actually.

7) The multiplayer still sucks because of how the game is designed. Unless you practice and follow the exact same build order as found on online faq's like everyone else you'll get crushed online. The game is inherently flawed for online play to give victory to people who build stuff in a certain way. Play against a terran and watch them and they will all build the same things in the places in the same order. If you enjoy playing others but don't like following the exact same pattern every time you play and play to rush through as fast as possible then you won't have much success online or much fun either.

All in all blizzard has made Starcraft 2 vastly inferior to Starcraft 1 in every way possible. Aside from the fact the graphics are nice in part 2 there isn't a thing I liked as much as or better. I can't recommend this game unless it costs 15 bucks or less to you.",Just buy the original Starcraft instead.,1303171200,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It is a hodgepodge of several failed overhauls stacked on top of each other where nothing really works like it is supposed to.  The graphics are dated, the community is terrible, there is nothing to do, the quests are dreadful and if you get past all of that somehow you will discover the Star Wars universe itself isn't even replicated correctly.

This game is an utter joke and if you want a decent Star Wars experience I would instead encourage you to check out Knights of the Old Republic (1 and 2), Empire at War or even Lego Star Wars instead of this piece of garbage.

One of my biggest pet peeves is people writing video game reviews on Amazon when they haven't really played the game. Well, that's exactly what this review is going to be; and there is a very - very good reason I didn't play much of this game.

I love Sonic the Hedgehog, and if you read any of my other reviews you'll know that I also loved the Wii version of this game. The racing stages were amazing but unfortunately the Werehog wore thin too quickly and took up too much of the game. When I finally got a chance to play this for the 360 I was SO excited to see how the racing stages compared to the Wii! Would they be better? Would they be worse? The answer is...what racing stages?

In the two hours that my brother and I played this game we didn't get to one new racing stage. The only one we played was the one in the demo that we've played over and over again. Our time with Sonic Unleashed for the 360 was spent playing pointless quick time button mashing games in a plane that we didn't get to fly, and the rest was fighting a lot of bad controls, bad camera angles, bad and boring combat, awful level design and repetitive enemies in the Werehog sections.

In the Wii version the Werehog was only pointless. It could be fun at times but for the most part it was just a tacked on detour from what you really want to do in a Sonic game. It was inane, but it wasn't that much of a problem. Here, it's that much of a problem.

In the 360 version the Werehog is downright unplayable. The control is unresponsive and the hit detection is non existent half the time. You'd think that the game would compensate for such bad game play, but it actually does everything it possibly can to make things even worse for you. You get almost no save points which means if you've just spent half an hour lumbering around trying to hit things and punching nothing but air only to FINALLY - MIRACULOUSLY - get to where you are suppose to go and die, you have to re-do everything you just did OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

And that's when this game got shipped back to the rental place, but not before something unfortunate happened: I almost broke my brothers controller. True story! I've played a lot of bad games, but I've never played one so frustrating that I lost control of my self and chucked someone else's property on the floor before realizing what I was doing. But I have now; THANKS Sonic Unleashed!

A lot of people will say this review is unfair as I didn't actually play the game. Maybe the racing stages made up for the bad Werehog part of this game. I wish I knew. All I can say is: don't blame me for not knowing. If the game makers wanted me to play the racing stages, they should have let me play the racing stages. I'm not gonna spend two hours laboring through a bunch of bad clunky platforming. I'm just not.

The graphics are terrible and glitchy. Some of my characters disappear from the screen. The voices are not in sync with the character's lips. The music is uninspiring. The graphics freeze every 30 seconds, but the voices keep going. It take the game about 5 second to catch up with the voices. It's definitely NOT Skyrim. The environments are not really detailed. The aren't rich and inviting. I thought that there would be more of an open world, but this is not a massive RPG like Skyrim. You follow a path, kill demons and such long the path, and fight the boss at the end. Sometimes there is loot, sometimes not. You can press the R3 button to locate codex and loot. But I didn't see anything happen to my map or the game screen when I pressed R3. The attacks are simple and uninspiring. I thought your skill attack would be more specular. They're all run of the mill.

The music seems so pedestrian. There is no passion or force. After awhile the music got on my nerves.

The character customization was ok. You can change your face and hair, but that's it. You can't change your body type. So not getting taller or fatter or skinnier. There are limited choices for hair styles. I was playing as the male elf and there was no option for a beard. The hairstyles are ugly too. There are limited voice choices as well.

I played what felt like the first chapter. We went to this temple and fought this huge demon. Then my character woke up in a bed. I go outside to explore and the game exits back to my PS3 home screen. I've had to call Amazon and have my game returned for a refund. Maybe in a year or so--when the game is fix-- I will buy it again. I can't believe Bioware and EA would release this hot-mess of a game. It's just horrible. What suck even more is that I've been waiting for so long to play this game. And this is what I get.

I saw the full game and ALL the features because a friend of mine USE to own it. He threw it in the trash after playing it for about 5 hours.

The character creation is rather lame; Not much to choose from.

The music is.... ok.
The graphics are decent.
The NPC voices are nice, except for the captains and leader voices. They sound like they have a mouth full of food. lol.

The battle system is quite choppy and there is quite a bit of lag in the loading and new areas when you arrive.

The spell system is not bad, but is a bit weird to get use to.

The coolest feature I found was the ability to pick up all items in the area by pressing Z on the keyboard, but umm, that's about the extent of it.

I really didn't like the game and am glad I tested the demo and my friend's copy before I purchased it.

My son's 3DS XL wouldn't power on after 2 months of purchasing the item.  He didn't even play with it that long because he was on restriction from it for 2 weeks.  I called Nintendo and sent it in for repair.  They email me back with a $65 plus tax & shipping rate to fix the console.  They said it wasn't covered under warranty because it was ""abused"".  I called the Nintendo repair phone number to complain that was not the case.  They claimed that the socket to plug into electrical outlet was loose which was affecting it being powered on, so it wasn't covered under warranty.  They said my son must have been rough with unplugging the console.  I told them that my son barely played with it and he has taken care not to handle it roughly.  Anyways, after getting transferred to a manager, I complained that the product must be defective and that I had just spent over $300 for that console & mentioned I have spent a lot of money on other Nintendo products (Original Nintendo, Gameboys, Wii, etc).  She lowered the cost of the repair at $30 and told me that if it had same or another issue, they would just replace it since it just might be a defective product.

Fast forward almost a year later (February 2014), the 3DS touch screen just stopped working in the middle of a game.  Sent it in for repair again and received same pricing.  They claimed that the console has liquid damage which is BS because my son did not spill anything on it.  I truly believe Nintendo will say it's some other damage that isn't covered under warranty.  They claim that their products is covered under warranty, but in actuality, they will claim some other issue like abuse to not have to honor their warranty!  After getting this product fixed the 2nd time, if it doesn't work again, I am certainly not replacing in anymore Nintendo consoles.

Unfortunately, although it is listed as ""1-4 players"", that isn't quite true.  Only the single-player ""Story Mode"" gives you access to the entire thirty games available.  The Co-op stage only lets you play five games, about two of which are worth playing more than once.  There is a simple shooting gallery (nothing moving though), a frog-fishing game, whack-a-mole, an incredibly dull game where you move a hoop along a cord and one more that was so boring I can't even remember it.

As the single-player, you can spend time unlocking the rest of the games, which are mainly variations on the original five games.

Jillian Michaels Fitness Utimatum 2009 is a failure on so many levels. The response to your movements is poor at its best and completely unresponsive at its worst.  One activity has you running through tires (like football players do in practice).  I could not get it to move even one step and yet there is Jillian's voice telling me what a great job I am doing and that I should go for the final push.  I sweated from frustation trying to get the other activities to recognize my movements.

The one thing Killer Instinct does better than MK is the combo system.  It's easier and more enjoyable to unleash combos to your opponent in this game.

So what the geniuses at the helm do next? They decide to make the same mistake yet again - by choosing the same DRM scheme that made BIOSHOCK, MASS EFFECT and SPORE infamous: SecuROM 7.xx with LIMITED ACTIVATIONS!

MASS EFFECT can be found in clearance bins only months after its release; SPORE not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back, fed up with idiotic DRM schemes. And the clueless MBAs that run an art-form as any other commodity business decided that, ""hey, why not jump into THAT mud-pond ourselves?""

The original FAR CRY was such a GREAT game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with (especially without its original developing team). Now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known, much hated and totally useless DRM scheme that turns it into another Rent-A-Game no one wants. Were I a UBISOFT stock-holder I would be ordering my broker to ""Sell-Sell!-SELL!!"" instead of posting this...

Ever since its 7.xx version, SecuROM has NOTHING to do with ""fighting piracy"". All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.
That is why even the STEAM versions as well as the (free) Demos of such games are infected with it. SecuROM will borrow deep into our PC systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with. It will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothership.

Lately, these security concerns have been accentuated as known Trojans seem to be exploiting SecuROM's backdoor access for their own purposes. In effect, installing a SecuROM-infected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the game.

And the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is FAR CRY 2 - a game crippled by LIMITED INSTALLATIONS! No, thanks. I think I 'll pass this one too.

The only people who do not care about SecuROM are, in fact,...pirates! Because cracking games ""protected"" by this contraption apparently is very easy. Every single game that was supposedly ""protected"" by SecuROM was cracked hours withing its release!
To everyone else though, SecuROM (or StarFORCE or any other hazardous DRM scheme) is a core issue that needs to be resolved before PC gaming can evolve any further. And the best way to resolve such issues is market correction.

It is with this qualified gaming background that I can confidently say, this is the worst title ever released by Blizzard.  This feels like a low quality Activision game that has licensed Blizzard's intellectual property.  The content of the game can be finished in 7 hours but then, you get to replay it again for four times on different difficulty levels.  Awesome game design?  No, it's not very fun.

Monsters on Inferno mode (where you get level 60 gear) have many abilities to make your character uncontrollable, e.g. fear, jailing, knockback, pull-ins, and others, which are never fun alone, and downright stupid when they occur in combination together.  Some combinations make it so you just end up dying over and over no matter your level of gear just so you can beat certain mob packs.  Not having control of your character is just bad game design.  Then you end up with a huge repair bill.

Graphics are horrible.  It looks like a game that was made 7 years ago but got shelved.  Act 1 and Act 2 graphics look worse than WoW or SC2 graphics.  Act 3 and 4 were clearly made later, possibly even by a different developer team at Blizzard and is barely passable.

People will argue that Steam isn't DRM but that's exactly what it is. I have the game on CD with the expansion. I can't install them though because steam doesn't work right. The game won't install while Steam is offline, so why do I have a disc? I don't know. When I go online, steam won't connect because either their servers are down or windows firewall blocks something (although I doubt that since I turned it off, but that's what steam says). People who pirated the game are playing it right now, probably reading this post and laughing because their copies just work and they didn't pay $50 for the first DVD and $50 for the expansion like I did.

I've owned an xbox 360 before but It has not worked for some time now due to the red ring of death. With the new xbox 360 the red ring of death isn't even possible because there in no red led light in it and microsoft has addressed the issue by having the new xbox 360 produce a significantly lower amount of heat inside the hardware. I love the xbox 360, Forza 3, and halo reach (i know its not out yet). I also own a ps3 here is why i like my ps3:
 1)When you save videos on the playstation 3, the video icon is way better. For the ps3 it plays a small loop of the video and its up to you to choose which section of the video to loop. With the xbox 360 there is simply a picture that comes with the video.
 2)When you fast forward videos on the xbox 360 its glitchy and it skips scenes, with the playstation 3 there is a smooth steady flow of the video.
 3)Blu-ray makes the xbox 360 suck, but not too bad because you can download hd videos on the xbox 360 through the xbox live video market place.

Im giving this a 1 star to make you read my article if i were to give it a 5 star you would not read it because there are so so many. for all of you who complain about my 1 star rating lowering the overall rating i have three words get a life. honestly if that bothers you, you must have a perfect live we have a bad war in afghanistan, politicians who depend on corporations, and an oil spill.

Reasons why I enjoy the 360...
1) 250 gig hard drive verses my 40 gig on the ps3 i know they make better and bigger hard drives with the ps3 but this is my situation.
2)It is so, so, so quiet.
3)Both the ps3 and 360 have wireless internet but the new 360 downloads faster, a lot faster.

The one word to summarize this game: BORING.

I bought this a few days ago. There's a reason, I now know, that a 10 month old game is selling for only $20 at a local big box. I hear DA: Origins was great. I never played that. Some reviewers here are reviewing DA 2 not on its own merits but as an inferior comparison to DA: Origins. I am not. I really have no horse in this race. Another reviewer said this is a terrible RPG but a great button masher. I disagree heartily. If you've ever played Diablo, that is a 50 IQ brainless button-mashing experience, but it's also unbelievably fun. This is not that. Although the combat (what little I've seen when not stuck in a dialog screen) is nothing more than idiotic smashing of A, the rest of the game is not an action adventure at all.

I have played only several hours but based on what I've experienced and read elsewhere, that's enough. Yes, I'm reviewing after only a few hours, but I don't want to play anymore. I have been playing RPGs for many, many years now and this is one of the worst impressions I've had. Here are the main problems:

1) Graphics are bad. They are quite dated in comparison to what the 360 is capable of and we've seen elsewhere
2) Terrible city design. The entire city feels like it was auto-generated. The space between buildings is absurdly large (streets you could drive parade floats down side by side) and it makes everything feel extremely artificial. Too many squares and rectangles and not enough people. It just feels unnatural. They were going for grand, they got weird.
3) Way too much talking between characters. I have spent much more time in dialog than in actual combat or doing anything in the game. The ""game"" is way too much chatter and unfortunately since it's all voiced it cannot be skipped. Voiced is fine--but only if I can skip it to speed things up.
4) You know something is wrong when you level up and can't be bothered to go into the menu to choose stats. I think the moment I hit ""auto-level up"" I realized I didn't care at all anymore and I wouldn't be playing again. I never cared, nor felt it mattered.
5) I've never had a game for only a few days and when bored (this evening) struggling to find something else to do so I wouldn't have to go down and force myself to like it.

I actually read some (not enough) reviews of this before purchase. I was expecting a dumbed down RPG with a rich story and fast-paced action, but it isn't. It's slow and uninspiring.

The game was severely rushed, and there is a reason why the lead designer of Dragon Age Origins left the company during design of this. He probably just couldn't stomach it. I know I couldn't.",I am not am embittered DA Origins fan,1328486400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

When they arrived, I played with them and enjoyed them for a couple months. However, after a few months they began not responding. It wasn't just to the one either, it was all of the lightchucks. They weren't responding, and it wasn't like I was giving them a hard time. I am an adult, and I was playing Animal Crossing City Folk, so obviously it wasn't through intense workouts.

They started to not function properly, shortly after the warrant yhad expired, and it wasn't just the lightchuck, it was also the glowing Wiimote, but the lightchuck went downhill much faster than the wiimote.

a) The game is devoid of fun.
b) You move about as fast as a crippled snail, even when running.
c) The NPC's ""talk"" after you have concluded your text-based talking.
d) The graphics may have been good about 5 years ago but they are just muddy and dull now.
e) The game is open ended but as a result there is nothing really to do, and the land is so barren that you just get incredibly bored very fast.

I now know why there is no demo for this game, if there were no one would buy it.

BTW, some have argued that the ""slowness factor"" is a graphic/system problem but it is not.  Your ""character"" simply is exceedingly slow, there is little jaggies or system level slowness.  If you have played something like everquest or WoW, think of it like this; running in Morrowind is at the speed of walking in those games, and walking in Morrowind is about half that speed.

Also, the ""since of wonder"" at seeing stars is old, been done everywhere and doesn't impress.  Walking down a road and seeing a door stuck in the side of a mountain means ""dungeon"" in morrowind...there is no since of wander, the dungeons are doors in the side of a mountain.

finally, if you want to buy this thing go ahead, clearly it appeals to some people.  I rate it as one of the worst games I've ever spent money on and furthers my belief that if a game doesn't  over a demo then there is some reason they are hiding it until after you make the purchase.","Old, boring, dumb",1125014400,12,"{'Edition:': ' Game of the Year', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

1.0,False,"09 23, 2012",A31IUO67L76EC4,B006VB2UNM,Mickey The Mouse,"Alot of negative reviews, so I won't cover the basics.  The overall problems are glitches and poorly executed mulitplayer.

First the multiplayer.  The problem comes in connected careers online.
1)  Allowing people to be either coaches or players in the same league.  This should never happen.  Pick one or the other.  If your a player, guess what, your team will always be horrid.  Your AI GM/Coaching staff will make stupid decisions, while the player coaches will scout out good players, and make the right moves for their teams.
2)  Unless the league commish advances the week forcefully, you have to wait for each player to check the box ""advance week"".  When its a few of your buddies, not that bad of an idea.  When your in an online league of 32 players, you can wait weeks to advance one week in the season.  Unplayable.
3)  Why not make a online league where 3-4 people can be players on the same team, and play just the CPU?

Glitches (this is what will cause you the most grief), in no particular order.

Rate from never to always: rare, sometimes, 50/50, more often than not, always

1) Randomly throwing to the wrong receiver.
Rate: Rare.
When it happens most: When the receiver you want is way too wide open (glitch in coverage?)
What happens: You push B and it throws to X or vice versa.  Same with Y and A (of course these are xbox controls).  I have not noticed any effect on RB.  usually results in an interception as well.

2) Clock not stopping for ball carrier going out of bounds.
Rate:  More often than not to always
When it happens most: N/A
What happens: Player has the ball and runs or is pushed out of bounds.  Even the announcers will comment that the ball carrier went or was pushed out of bounds.  The clock will not stop but continue running.  (Maybe EA has programmed in the replacement officals?)

3) Random turnovers between quarters
Rate: Sometimes in regular season, 50/50 in playoffs and suoperbowl.
When it happens most: Between 3rd and 4th (Especially in playoffs or superbowl.)
What happens: You have the ball on first or second down at the end of a quarter (not the half).  At the start of the next quarter (usually 4th when it happens) it is miraculously the other teams ball.

4) Random turnovers after huge gain plays
Rate: Sometimes
when it happens most: 4 quarter/2 minute drill, especially in playoffs or superbowl in connected career player
What happens:  You throw or run for a huge gain, get the ball way down the field for a come from behind score, with not much time left on the clock.  All of a sudden, you are at the ""next play, sim to next human control play"" screen.  You click either and the game is over.  At first I thought it happened b/c I was qb and we had 23 seconds left and down by 2 and on the 5 yrd line.  I thought the FG unit was brought on, but no.  The play log just had my 40 yrd pass to Calvin Johnson, and then the next line was game over.  I have since had this happen to me a total of 7 times in 3 seasons.  Luckily, I was in offline connected career so it didn't autosave.

5) Impossible Interceptions
Rate: Sometimes
When it happens most: In connected careers, player, qb.  Two games in the season, and the conference championship, and superbowl.
What happens:  You go to throw a bomb down the field for a 40/50 yrd pass, and a lineman intercepts the ball.  Yes a lineman, or sometimes a LB close to the DL. Your throwing a bomb down the field?  At the point of the DL, its like 15ft in the air.  Especially cause I drop back about 10 yards from the snap.  Other times, you throw to a wide open receiver, and the safety somehow makes it across the field in the time it takes you to throw a 10 yrd pass.

6) Increased rate of interceptions, fumbles, and penalties
Rate: More often than not in playoffs
When it happens most: Playoffs and superbowl.
What happens:  See title.  You make it too the playoffs, the game forces your team to commit more penalties and turnovers.

Overall, too many glitches for a franchise that has been around this long.  Alot of improvements/options, but 10 steps back in playability.  Seriously, I would rather dig out my Sega Genesis and play Madden 96.",Worst Madden to date,1348358400,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Beyond Two Souls (BTS) is a mashup of video gaming and movies.  In brief, it is my opinion that this game is not worth anyone's time, nor anyone's money.  While I do not believe there are any spoilers, here, your opinion may differ, and you should take that into consideration before continuing with this review.

Executive summary:
Boring, it is a rehash of many Science Fiction films and Literature.
Boring, it has little, if no, game play.
100% Predictable.

Let's just say for one to have a good Movie, one must have a good Story. There is nothing new about this particular story.  I would like to say that there are spoilers, but there are none.  In every direction this movie took, visions of Carrie, Poltergeist and every Telekinetic SciFi film or story came to mind.  Every action, every move, were 100% predictable.  In some sequences, the action was so familiar, I could not help but feel the Developers literally copied the movements and actions from many popular action movies. Yes, Deja Vu applies here.

Now let's talk about game play.  I think I was too kind to call it lame.  In multiplayer mode, one player is in normal mode, the other is psychic mode.  The psychic mode needs to be transferred every time, say to an iPad.  The controls were so clumsy, I finally gave up and just played solo.  For instance, you have to move the controls such that two icons are brought together to invoke a specific telekinetic action.  If I were telekinetic, from Carrie to any other SciFic film or book, the telekinetic action is an Act of Will, not requiring any specific set of hand motions.  The nose bleeding was clearly something from Firestarter (a film about a young girl who could telekinetically start fires).

At those times you are allowed to control the character, the control generally deals with very mundane actions.  For instance, to cross a river, the character moves by you pushing the L1 and R1 buttons to make her cross the river.

In the final phases of the game, our Protagonist must choose her future life.  There have been several video games that deployed this concept, most notably the early Silent Hills games.  However, in BTS, the end results are barely influenced by your actions through the game, but by your choices with whom you will take up with.  I did not get through all the choices, but I understand there are about 21 endings.

The Developers had some very good assets, motion captured from some very attractive and very talented actors.  However, it is not the first time good talent was misapplied to a cliched story, and as an excuse for poor game design.  A saving grace is that you can get through the game fairly quickly, say about 10 to 12 hours.  However, when I look the games I have played, such as Skyrim, Borderlands, Borderlands 2, even Defiance (as derivative as it is), are more fun, more exciting, more interesting, but I am also comparing games that are not of the same genre: BTS is a linear movie, while the others are open ended sandboxes.

The sad part about this is, should this have been made into a 100% movie, it is so badly cliched, so predictable and boring, it would barely make the $5.00 Direct to Video bin at Fry's.","It's Deja Vue all over again, boring, lame game play",1382572800,18,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

The graphic's twitch when you fight or just perform an open combo when there's no enemy around. Kiddie looking games with adult content are a great idea (I'll take CONKER anyday).

1.0,False,"05 27, 2011",A3JWUUSLIGTBHM,B004WLRQCI,ChrisInCali,"The Nintendo Wii, it never lived up to it's potential. I was so excited for this system at it's launch. I waited in line with my cousin over night at Target to be one of the first to buy it. I picked it up with Zelda. Even from day one I was unimpressed... with full hype-goggles on I knew something wasn't so hot about this system.

I booted it up, with my official Nintendo brand the competent cables(that cost extra) so I could play in 480P... I knew it wasn't going to look as good as the 360, but I didn't care.  I just cared about the games. Much to my surprise when I hooked everything up just to come to the realization of how cheap it all felt. The sensor bar(which I didn't even know it needed at first), the look and feel of the menu's & hardware. The Wii-mote with this tacky wired dongle attached to it.  It all felt like some cheap Chinese knock-off system, but it wasn't, this was the new Nintendo hardware!  I couldn't believe it.

Then I played Zelda for about 8 hours straight the next day. The whole time I wonder when it was gonna start getting good, at the time Zelda was by far and away my favorite franchise so I knew it couldn't be this dull. I kept playing, then I bought some Virtual Console games, then a few other ""AAA"" titles eventually came out and I bought them all... never quite feeling satisfied with them. They all felt very uninspired, and were missing that magic Nintendo of old had in their games.

Then I started realizing that the whole system experience was like this for me; dull, uninspired, cheap, a side-step instead of a leap forward. So I sold it, and with the exception of Mario Kart, I haven't missed it at all. I watched as my idea of what I would want from Nintendo was constantly beaten with the truth of what Nintendo had become. They sold Wii Fits, and Wii Motion Plus', and Wii plastic shotguns, and put out Wii condoms, and added more warning screens, but they never seemed to stop all the non-sense and put the focus back into creating a new classic Nintendo master piece.

I've been more than happy with my PS3/DSi set-up. I get my serious gaming on my PS3, and my Nintendo fix on the DS. I also have a 360, but I'm becoming increasingly more displeased with that system after having 2 break on me, and now all this Kinect junk being pushed, but that's for another review..

What's left for the Wii... Skyward Sword? A game which everything I've seen from it looks like a poor excuse for what the Zelda franchise used to be. It's look like a full on waggle-fest, puzzle game. Not the great action adventure with light RPG & puzzle elements of old.

Nintendo use to design controllers for games to make them work better(Super Mario 64), now they design games around their gimmicky controllers to sell more copies to the curious casuals(Wii Fit).

There's little value in the first-party game library, and hardly any value in the third-party library.

I was okay with Legend of Mana, despite the fact that the non-linear gameplay made it very convoluted to play and I really couldn't figure it out.

But I HATED this game, with a passion. The puzzles and walking around in general were hindered by the screwed up over-zoomed in camera angle that managed to make me dizzy just from trying to look around, the fact that you're forced to use items or bang enemies into each other to get stats, the fact that targetting is so horrible that you frequently miss when trying to do simply things with your vine, and then after you've spent hours doing this crap you find out... get this, IT'S RESET AFTER EVERY LEVEL rendering your efforts worthless. The music was so annoying it put me to sleep and woke me up, several times, during a boss battle. How could you fall asleep during a boss battle, you ask? Well the annoying camera angles actually gave me such a headache that I literally nodded off.

The puzzles were extremely limited and annoying. Have a wheel that you need to spin? You'd be lucky if you can even hit it, due the bizarre camera angles, and very limited controls.  Why have a vine whip if you can't use it to climb?  Compare this to Okami, where if you want to fill a water container, you can, if you want to climb with vines, you can. Heck, if you want to paint on a wall, you CAN, and you can even fish. Wanna roam around bashing into random people? No problem. I couldn't even seem to talk to people in Dawn of Mana from what I tried (up to Mortmont where I got stuck wandering in circles looking for a solution for a rather obvious jump switch puzzle), much less figure out what the hell I was supposed to do with this money I had, and they didn't even bother to properly save my game!

1.0,False,"04 10, 2015",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B004J6I0YO,Adrian Jenkins,"Holy smokes - I am stunned to read the praise of this stinker. With no hyperbole, these games (well, the two I made it through) rank among the worst games I have ever played, on any system. I bought this game years ago (for a price lower than Amazon's current one). I played through Sands of Time, and it took me three years to start Warrior Within (and honestly, I only started it because I was sick of seeing the 0% on my PSN account). I played Warrior Within, and nearly cried.

How bad are these games? Let me count the ways:

The Sands of Time (1 star): Where do I begin? Well, let's start with aesthetics. SoT is one of the ugliest games I've seen (even accounting for its time of release). Combat is a joke, which is good, because the combat system is atrocious. Outside of combat, the game is slow and pretty boring. The excitement is generated solely by the biggest offender here - the wonky control. You will die, quite a bit, simply because the controller betrays you. I can appreciate the concept here, but the execution is flawed beyond belief. Although the game takes less than 10 hours to play and plat, I can't even recommend it to trophy hunters. It's just too frustrating to die because the control betrays you on a wall climb (and it WILL betray you). There is nothing difficult here, other than the pathetic development of the game.

Warrior Within (0 stars): Sands of Time caused me to wait 3+ years before I played Warrior Within. And Warrior Within makes Sands of Time look like God of War. Were it not for the fact that the concept is good, Warrior Within might rank as the worst game on the PS3 (taking over the slot ignominiously held by Man Vs. Wild or Deathly Hallows I). All of the problems in Sands of Time are magnified tenfold here. I know this game inside and out, due to the fact that I had to play through it THREE TIMES to get the plat. Every problem in this game is burned into my mind. Where do I begin?

Well, somehow, this game is actually uglier than Sands of Time. The CGI scenes are choppy, and the in-game scenes are just pathetic. Women who are ostensibly sexy looks like brides of Frankenstein. The prince himself has an atrocious design. Further, the change between the CGI and the in-game cutscenes is remarkably jarring. There is an (embarrassing) sequence early on with an enemy wearing a revealing gray thong. But in the game? Looks like a black bikini bottom. At one point, the prince becomes the Sand Wraith. The CGI looks good here - the Sand Wraith looks like some creepy Heartless or something. In game? I wouldn't even recognize him as the same character. Enemy designs are poor, environmental graphics are a mess - this looks like a rushed, shoddy production.

The story is a standard time travel plot, with absolutely no logic to it whatsoever. It's not complicated to follow, but it's complicated to explain rationally. Time travel rarely works, but when it does, one needs to have some kind of rule or structure. Long story short...<yawn>. You're playing out the string for most of the game, and only at the very end do you get any payoff whatsoever.

The combat in this game might be the worst combat I've seen in 10 years. It is execrable. In some games, combat allows you to lock onto enemies. In others, you are free to move about. In the former, the control often switches to a different ""combat"" scheme when you lock on. In the latter, the control scheme generally remains the same. Warrior Within eschews both of these ideas for some god-awful hybrid. The game somehow chooses your lock-on for you. In battle against a single enemy, this is fine, but against multiple enemies, the game is poor at switching to the nearest threat. The AI is effectively stupid here - they drift in and out of combat, which would generally make them easy to deal with, BUT since you can't choose to whom you are locked on, this actually serves them well; as the current threat dances away, new threats will come forward. You remain locked onto the previous threat, and take a beating from the new one. Thus, there is little strategy in combat - run around, stick and move, boring boring.

Even more problematic is the fact that the control scheme changes in combat. As in many games, you have a jump button and an attack button. However, in combat, the jump button becomes a sort of dodge roll. I won't even begin explaining how horribly this roll is controlled. My biggest problem is that sometimes, the game decides, ""Nah, you don't need to roll here. Instead, just JUMP OFF A CLIFF TO YOUR DEATH."" In particular, when you fight the final boss(es - depending on game choices, the final boss can change), you are on a suspended structure. If you dodge roll too close to the end of the cliff, the prince just does a Peter Pan off of the structure (literally - he will turn, face the opposite direction of the boss, and jump to his death). Yes, you can rewind time, blah blah blah, but again, the fault is completely in the control. Why the game didn't dedicate one button to dodging, and one to jumping, I'll never know. There are 8 easily-accessible buttons available!

Despite these horrid combat controls, the game is remarkably easy. You can skip many encounters (basically, as long as you can get your character out of combat position, you can run away). With the exception of one of the final bosses, the rest are painfully easy, even on the hardest difficulty (that boss, the Dahaka, makes up for it - he is brutally difficult on the highest difficulty, and no picnic on the lowest). Basically, Warrior Within is like Sands of Time in this regard - your greatest enemy is control...
...
...and the camera. I remember horrid cameras from the PS1 days, and a few later games. The camera here is one of the worst I can remember. You are constantly fighting with it in combat. Moreover, combat controls are based on your position relative to your enemy, and not on the camera. In short, the control directions can change on the fly, relative to your field of vision.

Given that this is Prince of Persia, there is also the wall-running, trap-dodging, and general mayhem you've come to know. Again, control craps the bed. While traps can be difficult to manoeuvre on their own, the shoddy controls make them much, MUCH more difficult than they should be. Moreover, there are timed sections in the game, which are just painfully bad because of the control (and that's too bad - this had much potential).

Oh, let us not forget the soundtrack. It is hilariously inept. As an old metalhead, I just shook my head most of the time. It doesn't fit the game in any way, shape of form. Sound in general is bad - the voice work is mediocre, and the general screeches made by enemies are jarring because they sound so bad. Moreover, sometimes they are muted terribly, and other times, they blare our of your speakers.

All of this would be worthy of 1 star, but what really puts the feces icing on the cake are the glitches. Ubisoft has always been bad about QC, but you would think that they would fix gamebreaking glitches on a re-release. Nope. It is entirely possible (and pretty easy, actually) to glitch your game so that, just as you move to the final boss, it freezes, and you can't do anything other than start over. Collecting all of the collectables in a single playthrough is a good way to accomplish this (the ninth treasure chest, in particular, often causes this glitch).

Moreover, there are design flaws in the game. If you do levels out of (a completely unknown) order, you can put yourself into a situation that requires you to start over (and again, you will only see this near the end of the game). This is unacceptable.

Finally, back in the day, I'm pretty sure that you could unlock earlier Prince of Persia titles in this game. That's been removed. Sorry - there's money to be made. Contrast this, e.g., with the Metal Gear HD Collection (one of the best), which left in the excellent Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

Shame on Ubisoft for allowing this, and shame on these reviewers who look past these very real flaws in praising this crap-pile.

61 hours in, basically forcing myself to play, I would have previously given this game maybe a 6/10.  The last 6 hours have been so replete with terrible story and numerous bugs that I struggle to find any desire whatsoever to actually finish the game.

There have been a couple of beneficial changes to multiplayer (matches are now 7 rounds including extraction, which is a very welcome change) but all heavy melee has been removed, all normal melee is the same animation, there are no individual melee animations (like geth or asari heavy melee) and jumping melee is mostly just a normal melee with a very minimal increase in range.  Melee lockon is now nonexistant and a good chunk of your melee attacks will probably miss, especially if there is the slightest bit of latency.  No behind cover grabs also limits your online experience to just run and gun, with no real tactical choice in gameplay.  ME3 I would spend hours on end daily in multiplayer. ME:A I do a couple matches every few days at most, and I don't plann to continue much longer.

The story is trash.  BW gave a bunch of choices to make, though most of them don't seem to have any impact on actual gameplay, and most of the choices are 1) sorta ok or 2) really bad.

Krogans have soft squishy voices.  98% of the males lost their quads and have become wusses like they have no spines either.  The females are more dominant now. Complete role reversal from ME3.

The ONLY character that interests me as a romanceable option is Suvi.  She's lesbian only.  Good luck to all the male protagonist players.

The bugs are stupid.  Enemies float in mid air.  You drink from invisible glasses. Your legs have a mind of their own in conversations, like having a seizure.

I'm a web developer and gamer. I spend at least 15 hours each day every day on the computer using this product and 2 other Razer products. All three products (including this one) were purchased approximately 2 years ago.

My Relationship with Razer
==========
I was a Razer fanboy when I first got all of three of these products. In hindsight, I was about as stupid as people who blindly buy any Apple product.

All three Razer devices I'm writing about have failed. Using a BestBuy warranty, I have replaced them all at some point or another for failing.

I would NOT anymore recommend Razer products to anyone. I apologize to my friends who I raved about their products to, as now they are experiencing the same issues and terrible products I am.

Simple Summary Review - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
This keyboard is a very nice looking keyboard that functions decently as a keyboard. However, considering the premium price, I expect that the advertised features work and that this keyboard, at a minimum, functions as a keyboard should with no unexpected and unbelievably frustrating behavior. Unfortunately, not with this product or brand. After going through 2 keyboards over a period of 2 years, I'm throwing this device in the trash where it belongs. I'll never buy a Razer product again.

Pros - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard is truly a beautiful piece of plastic. I'm a particular fan of the matte buttons, which are hard to get dirty and easy to clean.
 - It is perfectly visible and usable in completely dark environments.
 - The buttons are very easy to press, leading to less wrist strain over long periods of time.

Cons - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard has a severe issue of getting stuck signals. It's like a key is stuck, but it's not. The only way to resolve is by unplugging the keyboard. This happens quite regularly, even without using the keyboard at all. I can't count the number of mornings I've woken up, turned on my monitor, only to find my keyboard just a typing an infinitely long Windows password on my locked computer. It's dreadfully annoying in gaming environments. Example: ""Sorry guys, I didn't mean to pull the boss. My keyboard is acting wierd!""
 - The media controller (touchpad) is absolutely useless. I have never gotten it to work, and it always goes crazy. It will regularly turn your volume down. It will constantly flash the keyboard lights. It will always start playing music when you aren't even near your computer. I contacted Razer support, and you know what they suggested? That I put a quarter on it! Yes, it a quarter will completely disable the touchpad. So for the past 2 years, I've been using a quarter to keep my wonky keyboard under my control, sacrificing one of the biggest reasons I wanted the keyboard to begin with.
 - The included USB port doesn't work. The power strength is a fraction of what normal USB ports are from my computer (so charging a phone, for example, takes multiples longer than using a USB port on the back of the computer). In addition, I've yet to get any device to actually function in it. Thumb drives are so convenient to plug in there, but the port simply doesn't work. Yes, I plugged both cables on the keyboard in. It just doesn't work.
 - The lights appear very dull through the buttons. This can be a pro or a con, as the lights shouldn't be distracting. However, I think it's just a little too dull, as it looks like the lights are failing. Pop a key off, though, and it's plain to see that the actual light source underneath is insanely bright.

In Hindsight
==========
I wish I had more nice things to say, but unfortunately, the truth is what it is. I wish I wasn't initially blinded by brand name, and I wish I would have done more research. Unfortunately, the past is the past, and the money spent on these 3 Razer products is lost forever. I hope Razer can fix their products in future generations, but I will never give them another shot. This is a premium product with a premium design. However, the functionality of their devices are equivalent of cheap knock-offs made in China.",Doesn't even deserve 1 star,1316131200,,{'Style:': ' Standard Edition'},

After a $150 ""investment"" on my part, we have played together zero times.  I have buyer's remorse for the money I shelled out, but feel even worse for dragging my brother into this mess.  All we can do now is wait (months?) for stable servers and patches that will hopefully fix at least the major issues.  The price of EA stock on the NASDAQ has dropped from over $27 this summer, to a little over $22 today.  On the one hand, I hope that this drives home the message to EA... on the other hand, I worry that they'll cut even more corners in an attempt to increase their profitability.

My advice to would-be buyers:
Wait.
Wait until the bugs and glitches are fixed. Wait until the servers are stable.

Much of the problems have been discussed already, but as I put my vote into the bin, I have to advise people to seriously consider whether they want to purchase this game.  I am a former Aerospace Engineer; I wrote software that tested the stability of aircraft (Navier Stokes Equations, Scientific Visualization).  I question the thoroughness of their testing strategy, if it was even tested.  The issue here is, what should you know before you purchase this game?

It crashes, and crashes and crashes.  You will put a large investment of time into a game that slowly deteriorates as you get closer to the goal.

It got to the point that as I got closer and closer to the end of the game, the more it crashed.  It got to the point of crashing between each transition between doors, in frustration I finally put the game away.  I have the update for the PS3, but this apparently made little if any difference.

It is a wonderful game when it works, but I give it a failing grade in regard to stability.  What is interesting is I am getting reports of failures on all platforms, which implies there is something inherently wrong with the game engine.

Whether intentional or not, to have such a poorly tested game put on the market implies a callous and cavalier attitude towards its customers.

I'll just list all the problems:

1) Red lights of death a month into ownership, after not having so much as scratched it and with moderate use.  Talked to Microsoft then had to send it into them.  Took 2 months for them to send me a refurb replacement.

2) from the moment I got the replacement, my game discs would not load correctly one third of the time, for which I have to eject disc, manually reposition, then re-insert.

3) Halo 3 map pack which I purchased separately not loading, except for one day (7 on the 7th for those who played Halo 3) of the month.  After hours of trying to figure out problem on the phone with MS reps, no resolution.

4) Xbox controller sticky analog shift only 6 months in, still no fix

5) Windows media player unable to sync

6) Not all codecs for Video Player downloading

7) Netflix requiring you to manually input your username and password each time you log in because I used a different Netflix account to log in initially (this only happens on the Xbox). Extermely annoying.

8) LOUD fan.  So loud I finally had to put it behind my bureau and cover/surround it with blankets,pillows just so the noise which is still loud is bearable.  Then it overheats and I get one red light of death (only one Microsoft?)

Each of these problems required scouring the Internet for possible solutions, talking to MS reps on phone, then physically attempting to fix the problem if applicable.  MS reps are completely oblivious, takes at least half an hour to wait and have to explain the problem before they even understand what the problem is.  In addition, when my Xbox Live subscription expired they attempted to do a bait and switch by first offering me 1 month for $1 and then another year for $20 on phone, I learned later it was $30 and they of course had no record of the conversation and talked as though *i* was the one who tried to ip them off.

Red Dead Redemption has incredible graphics and fantastic audio, which adds up to create an unparalleled atmosphere that makes you feel like you're really in the wild west.  But the missions and story are mostly boring and forgettable, with pointless side quests, and glitches horrible enough to essentially ruin the game.

Long Review:

Note:  This review is spoiler free with regards to the game's story.

Having all but conquered city based free roaming games, it's no surprise that Rockstar would eventually brand out to try and allow players to conquer other areas, this time taking us back to the turn of the century Wild West, essentially creating Grand Theft Horse.  Instead of fast motorcycles and flashy cars, you have horses and stagecoaches.  And while it sounds like an awesome and unique idea, we get an end product that's very pretty and incredibly atmospheric, but is packed with boring missions and glitches so severe, it at times ruins the game completely.

Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston as he heads across the lands of New Austin, the last holdout of the wild west on the Mexican border.  His mission is simple:  His lovely wife and young son have been kidnapped and held hostage by the government, and if he wants to get them back and get a clean break from his former life, he has to hunt down and take out the members of his old gang.

Taking on the role of John, you run around in a massive open ended world where you can go virtually anywhere you want to.  Every western cliche is here, including ramshackle old frontier towns, cactus, giant stone monoliths, forests filled with bears, adobe houses, and even tumbleweeds.  Like every other free roam game, you run around this world to find missions to complete, and thus advance the story.  It's an incredibly beautiful world, as unlike Liberty/Vice/Stilwater city, there are no skyscrapers, no malls, or giant buildings.  Everything here is turn of the century technology, with the biggest building being only two stories tall.  As a result, the world feels massive and virtually endless.  You feel like a tiny ant in the middle of a very large and untamed world, and gives the game an epic feel that very few games can match.

However, Red Dead Redemption has the huge problem of feeling mostly pointless.  Almost all the missions follow this pattern:

1.  Get on a horse and ride halfway across the map with a partner.
2.  Listen to said partner deliver expositional dialogue to advance the plot.
3.  Reach destination.
4.  Kill everyone.
5.  Watch as partner rides off, abandoning you.
6.  Spend several minutes riding to the other side of the map to get your next mission, grumbling at how slow you're going.

As a result, most of the missions are very forgettable.  There are a few exceptions, such as fort assaults, boat rides, etc. but for the most part, the missions do very little to distinguish themselves.  As a result, it feels like you're just slogging through mission after mission, wondering when things are going to get interesting.  Thankfully, the third act of the game does reverse this trend, as there are a few creative and clever missions that are interesting to play through, but it's essentially too little, too late.

Outside of the story, there are a good amount of side missions, where you can become a bounty hunter and track down criminals, help random strangers out, go hunting for treasure, collect flowers, hunt animals, etc. but after a while, I realized that these quests are, in effect, pointless.  You mainly get money and fame/honor for doing them, but you get plenty of money from the story missions, and the fame/honor has barely any effect on the gameplay in general.  You can unlock rewards (such as riding stagecoaches for free), but it takes a long time to do so, and is not worth the effort.  I personally stopped doing all the diversions and side missions halfway through the game, because it felt like a waste of time.

Red Dead's story, like the missions, moves at a near glacial pace.  While the core story will make you want to keep going to find out if John rescues his family or not, it takes forever to get there.  The story contains a ton of fat that could be cut out, from characters who add nothing to the main plot, to virtually everything in Mexico, which has little to no impact on the main story.  It isn't until the third act that there's a sense of real danger and threat, and the drama picks up.  However, it's made worse by the fact that Red Dead makes one of THE worst mistakes a story can make...after the climax, it just doesn't end.  You feel like you've reached the end of the game, only to find that it keeps going and going and going and going.  After an hour of playing pointless, tutorial like missions, I lost my patience and wondered when the hell the game was going to end.  As a result, when the ending FINALLY came, I didn't care at all about what happened.

Then there's the game's many bugs and glitches:  If you hunt around on the internet, you'll come across humorous videos of people flying like birds, midgets acting like cougars, talking coyotes, etc.  However, those videos don't tell you about some of the other, more infuriating bugs.  Among the ones I experienced:

*In one mission, I assisted a group of people in taking over a fortress.  Afterwards, I went exploring and opened a standard chest to get some money.  Then an informant was running away from me, and seconds later, I was wanted for...something, and EVERYONE I had just helped to infiltrate the fortress was trying to kill me.
*Half my inventory would randomly vanish, ruining hours of hunting and searching for goods.
*I save a woman from being raped, and kill her captor.  A guy starts shooting at me, so I kill him in self defense.  For some reason, my honor goes down.
*I rent a room (AKA save/respawn point) in a new town, get involved in a duel and get killed, and get respawned several miles away in some OTHER town.
*John is being attacked by wolves.  I aim and pull the trigger, but John refuses to shoot his fully loaded gun and is torn to shreds.
*I run through a town, when the sheriff, for no reason whatsoever, shoots and kills me.
*The game crashes, making me loose most of my progress.

It's sad really...my first impressions of Red Dead Redemption were fantastic, but the more and more I played, I realized I just wasn't having any fun, and was starting to despise the game for how slow it was going, and how so many things felt pointless and annoying.  Add in how short and badly done the tutorials are (they appear on screen for about fifteen seconds, then vanish, often taking place in real time), John's annoying personality (he acts like Forrest Gump in a cowboy outfit, and I got the impression he was mildly retarded), and with the glitches, my annoyance turned to disgust.

In the end, while Red Dead Redemption is incredibly beautiful and very atmospheric, the story needs much editing and trimming, the missions are forgettable, the annoying characters will get on your nerves, the ending goes on longer then ""The Return of the King"" and the glitches will annoy you to no end.  I personally think Red Dead Redemption is yet another over-hyped game that turns out to be, at best, mediocre, and at worst, infuriating.","Very pretty, but as empty and hollow as a wasteland",1282867200,61,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

There are a lot of ""challenges"", but many of the ""challenges"" are either very easy or very quick, and most of them are focused on the Mario franchise. For example, ""Defeat the Goomba"", or ""Collect 10 coins"", and they are all so short they have very little replay value, ranging from 6 seconds to a little over a minute. Nintendo missed a real opportunity with this game, and should have included fewer challenges but made them longer and actually more challenging. For instance, ""Clear Super Mario Brothers World 5 without losing more than three lives"", or ""Clear Kid Icarus Stage 1 without falling to your death"". As a time waster it's alright, but it could have been much greater, especially if you were given the full game when you completed all the challenges.

1.0,True,"09 29, 2014",A3UCNSBH307OEV,B005TMFXZQ,Jan B.,"This game is not worth buying, but not for the reasons you may expect. Let me explain...

1. When I installed the game, I was expecting to play Heroes VI. What I got was the UPlay server having me play Shades of Darkness, at least that is what shows up on my screen as the available game to play. I see now way at all to play Heroes VI as a standalone game.

2. You are not able to create additional characters. At least, I could not figure out how and I have been playing this franchise for years. I simply wanted to start a new game with a whole new character because I was getting my ass kicked even on the easiest level and I wanted to experiment with the myriad of character traits you can apply points toward.

3. The game is hard, even on the easiest level. I used only one hero to do all of the battles. I brought out other heroes to pick things up that I would leave behind, so I could use my movement points only on what I wanted to. Let me be clear. I used this one hero for all battles and for picking up any chests or other artifacts. Everything else, like random resources laying around, was picked up by a different hero. By the time I came into contact with an enemy player. I was level 12 and the enemy player was level 15, and was a deadly threat. This game is far, far too hard on the easy level.

4. You get points that you can apply to your character. There are a lot of traits that you can apply points to, but suffice it to say that there is a considerable learning curve. You really don't get a good understanding of how these traits affect your hero until you are already playing.

5. Read number 3 again.

One thing I really, really liked about the game was the new layout and navigation of the town screen and the way the game mechanics worked. Some people really don't like this, but I did. Also, I found the graphics to be nice and thought they were a good improvement.

Overall, I would not have purchased this game if I did not have the entire series. I never would have bought the game if I had been given a free trial opportunity.

However, I ran into several problems less than a year into owning it. After a couple months, the mouse will randomly stop moving in one axis. It will be stuck moving only left to right, or up and down. I have to shake the mouse to get it working again. The mouse pad is always clean and clear, so no foreign object can be getting into the line of the laser besides maybe some dust particles. However, if a single spec of dust can screw up the lasers track, theres a big problem with the design as no other gaming mouse has done this

The other problems is the left click button sometimes does not register when I click, and the middle mouse button will sometimes double click when I only click once. The side buttons coating also seems to be rubbing off after little use.

As for the Tron effects, I was let down. The stock pictures make it looks like it has a fantastic glow, but in reality its kind of faint and the lighting is very uneven. The only sound it makes is on boot of the computer which does a short tinny lightcycle sound for a couple seconds which was neat but could have been better.

The mouse itself was a lot smaller than I was led to believe. Its too small to rest your hand on it, and you have to kind of cradle your fingers above it to use.

Razer support is the worst part of all of this. They take forever to reply to requests, then once they do, its just a prescripted troubleshooting walkthrough which among other things suggests the mouse isn't working because you spilled something in it to make the keys stick.

I'm now forced to go back to the default Sony controller, which is what I was trying to get away from in the first place.  The Nyko controller worked fine for about six months, and now it's ""bricked"" itself.  I know this controller was an aftermarket, ""budget"" product, but was I wrong to expect more from a manufacturer in the year 2012?

My original review is as follows:
The primary features on this controller are the L2/R2 buttons which give you just enough resistance to feel ""right"" when being pressed.  And they're in a concave shape (like the 360's controller) which prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping off.  If you're anything like me, you probably can't stand the mushy, imprecise, slippage-prone L2 and R2 buttons of the default Sony controller.

The ""rightness"" also applies to the face buttons and select/start buttons, which feel springy and deliver a nice popping feel, giving good feedback with every press.  The body of the controller itself is ever so slightly bigger than Sony's, which allows for a more comfortable, natural-feeling grip.

However, the L1 and R1 buttons by contrast feel flimsy.  The R1 button in particular has a tendency to get stuck in the ""pressed"" position, which actually does NOT affect performance: even when the button is stuck, my onscreen character doesn't actually fire his gun.  When I actually tap the button (in its stuck position), the added pressure on the button actually makes my guy fire.  This took a little time to get used to, but now I hardly notice it.

Clicking the thumbsticks (the L3 and R3 functions) takes a lot more effort than on Sony's controller; you have to really, REALLY press hard to make them click.  After using the thumbsticks for a few days, though, it's become somewhat easier.  Same with the D-pad; you have to press down hard for the movement to register.  Tilting the sticks to move my character/pan the camera also takes some adjustment; in testing out this controller on Saints Row 3, I had to turn my camera sensitivity way down because it was simply too fast.  Most games allow you to adjust camera sensitivity, so this isn't too big of an issue.

The fact this controller is wired may be a negative to some, but for me it's a positive because I don't have to keep buying batteries.  Another big drawback is that you can't use the ""home"" button on the controller to turn on your PS3; you have to hit the physical power button on your PS3, then hit the home button on the controller to sync it to the system.  Yes, you have to do this EVERY time you turn on your PS3.  It's a very minor step, but if your couch is very far away from your PS3, this could get annoying.  The controller has a nine-foot cable, with a Velcro strap to keep the cable rolled up if you don't need the entire nine feet (and let's face it, who would actually need all NINE feet?).

Perhaps the biggest drawback is that this controller does NOT have SixAxis controls.  You read that right: if you want to play Heavy Rain or Flower, break out the default controller.

I hope this review is useful (if a bit long!), with both the pros and the cons.  Overall I'm very happy with this controller, especially for only 13 dollars, as what was only supposed to be a second controller has now become my primary one.","Updated review, 11/9/12",1330732800,7,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},

I have been a fan of the series, and was pretty excited about Stronghold 3. Delayed after delayed the developers claimed to be holding back, because they were going to release the greatest Stronghold of all. Boy! was I disappointed by this installment.

The graphic was okay and an improvement overall. It's fully 3D modeling but it looks very outdated. The voice acting was on par, not good nor it's bad. What pushed me over was the cut scene. It's black and white sketches. Seriously, they didn't even put any effort in to even trying. They pretty much just took what the artist drew during the game's concept and based the whole thing on that. At least color it and paint it... I've never seen a $49.99 game this lazy before, if it was an indie game it would be different.

The walls are rather weak, the stone walls felt like they were made out of sticks. Catapult shots, BOOM!!! Big explosions, as if it was directed by Michael Bay. The arrows and projectile goes right through the walls. There's no advantage for defending. What's the point of a stronghold? The map size is tiny, and small at best. There is no skirmish.

The unit pathing is terrible. I thought my units were just loafing, but they were actually stuck on the ground. This is especially bad in combat, since they're stuck your units are just sitting ducks.

I often lose my units because it's so hard trying to find them. They sometime ""hide"" next to building, trees etc. Only way I could find them were if I click and hold my mouse and drag it in large area and see if I selected something. There should be an icon on the left for your units, at the very least icon for the Lord or hero units.

The game is very buggy and glitchy. I can't believe it made it out to production. What a waste of money for gamers. Do not support this type of behavior from a game developer!

Stronghold Crusader was the best of all. If you're looking to play Stronghold, go play that one.

What a joke.. They got rid of fantasy draft which was one of my favorite parts. Wouldnt it be fun to play a league with a few friends and all be able to draft your own team? I used to do this with a few buddies and it was a ton kof fun.

They added Connected Careers and next to impossible achievements to go with them, WOO HOO!

Another thing that drives me up a wall is the engine. They just keep switching it. One year its impossible to run the ball, or run up the middle. Thorwing anything over 15 yards is intercepted. The follwoing year its reversed. Its like every year you have to find the holes and try to exploit them.

Would it kill you to add pass ineterference? I get flat out tackled before I catch and nothing.

They know they have everyone ropped in and suckered into buying this game. I think in the next few years you will see them try to capitalize even more and try and whack us with DLC for $20. They have the NFL players who tweet and all this jazz about playing Madden so they have their little following but enough is enough. I am done with EA Madden. They lost my $60. I will buy the game used a year after release date to ensure they don't get another dime from me.

Go play Fifa and NHL...hmmh, how come their online games are flawless? ohh yeah it is because they actually care about the consumer.

The geeks who make Madden also need to watch some football because these ratings that they throw out there are absurd. Mario Williams is a 96? why beccause the idiot Bills signed him to a monster contract? look up his stats the last few years. 37 tackles and hes a 96..cmon man. Vernon Davis had 6tds in 2011 which you figure is the stats they go on..witten had 5 tds. Witten is a 96 and Davis is a 92.

I loved the old-school Nintendo Dpad, and the Playstation 2 Dpad is also very good.  They offered precise feel and control.  When I got my Xbox 360, I was shocked at how poor the Dpad was on that controller.  Everything else, including the analog sticks are so perfect, but the Dpad is clumsy and ineffective.  I'd try to hold back to block and end up jumping or doing some other random direction.
So after reading some reviews on different products, I thought I'd give the Madcatz fightpad a try.  When I received the package, I already had a gut-feeling that it was no good.  This was confirmed moments later as I tried to play with it.
1) The diagonals were very difficult to locate and I couldn't hit them with any consistency.  Very bad news in a fighting game.  I found that I had to hit a precise 30 degree angle from the down position to get down-back, and that should be 45 degrees, not 30.  But this could have been a defect in the particular controller I got, and might not be an issue in others.
2) However, I'm sure for all of these controllers, the feel of the pad would be the same.  The floating Dpad is very loosey-goosey.  While this makes it very easy to throw fireballs, any slight pressure will move you away from your intended position.  So if you needed to hold back to block, you might accidentally jump or duck.
3) The construction/material of the controller feels very light and cheap.  This wouldn't have bothered me too much if the controller worked great but it didn't, and this only added to my disappointment.",Low-quality Dpad,1292803200,,"{'Edition:': ' Akuma', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Blood Trails is not a direct sequel to Shellshock Nam 67', the title may suggest it but the two are very different. Blood Trails moves the franchise to the survival horror niche, which again is very different from the gritty warfare of the original. Sadly, Blood Trails rubs off as rushed, and poorly executed.

Very rarely do I pick up a title for cheap, and feel I got more from the instruction booklet then the actual game (in this case I picked the game up for 4.99$). So much of the game is a letdown, tank controls (sluggish beyond reasoning), a story that's as random as an ink blot test, and of course the inability to live up to the previous title which was even met with mediocre warm views. I tend not to bash games without a good reason, and I hope people understand I do not mindlessly hate on this title. A next generation title that makes you question the year in which it was made by the performance (or therefore lack of) is not a good way to start.

The plot was a bit rough to digest, between the main character you play as Private Nate Walker and his Sergeants actions to secure your willingness to fight against the unknown. Your brother has information worthwhile to the U.S. about some cargo dubbed `Whiteknight', you are sent forth to extract said info. During the course of the game you are faced with supposed horror (which to me the only horror comes from the difficult maneuvers due to the controls). The game takes place during the conflict in Vietnam, with the finale resulting in a coin toss with two separate endings, based on the players' choice.

The game leaves you wanting something else to fill the void of your purchase, as the game is rather short if you do manage to complete it. There is no multiplayer to speak of, raising or lowering the difficulty of the campaign doesn't add much to the experience, not even the 360's version with `achievements' help lengthen the game. I've spotted random enemies `respawning' before my eyes, frame rate drops, rough graphics that seem even more dated then the previous title, and a color palette consisting of brown, grey, green, and red, with of course an unhealthy amount of black (even when tinkering with the brightness setting things become either too dark to spot enemies, or too washed out to see straight).

Levels aren't exactly linear in a sense, the player can explore areas, but often times this turns into a state of confusion as much can be skipped with little to no consequences. Engaging the enemy can become a nightmare if your brightness setting isn't adjusted just right (as mentioned above). Even with the brightness accordingly set, I still find myself tossing of grenades, and wondering what happened to my inventory. You don't automatically collect ammo, you'll have to go over to a weapon and collect it yourself. Guns fire closer to bb or pellet guns than an almighty deafening rifle. In case I wasn't clear, sound quality is lacking.

The original Shellshock though poorly received still had a reasonable following, for the simple reason it was believable, lengthy, and had a lot to come back to with collectibles. Shellshock: Blood Trails feels like an attempt to demo a handheld game for a home console. Shame too, I was really interested in the future of this series.

I read the bad reviews before buying, but am a huge NHL fan and thought ""it couldn't be *that* bad"" and took a chance.  If anything it's worse than reviews and people have said.  If EA put out a Madden game this bad they'd be filing bankruptcy in a year.  It's a very, very, unfinished game, even patched with all of the updates to 10/23/2014 it would barely pass as a beta.  This is a case of a game that wasn't nearly done and should have been cancelled but was instead released.

Specifically, in addition to things other posters have mentioned, the game is simply barely playable.  For example, want to learn the controls?  Practice mode consists of you 1 on 1 against a goalie, no challenges, that's it.  No practice modes of any other type like defense or goalie.  In MUT, you can't even play the team of the week.

I fell in love with the game and wanted more so I started buying the older ones, so I could figure out the story line.  When I finally got my Xbox One, I had to get the master chief collection so I could play all the games again.  When I found out Halo 5 was on the move, I just had to get the Collector's Edition.  I pre-ordered the collector's, even though I saw the prices tag of $250.00.  Not sure how they come up with that price, but I really don't think it's worth that.  For what you get inside, It makes the statue come out to be about $175.00 to $200.00.  And personally, it's not worth that much.  It's a bunch of plastic done poorly and painted poorly.  The characters are loose on the stand, so watch out you don't break them.  I actually watched a youtube unboxing before I opened mine up, and his characters were really loose, the Master Chief seemed drunk as he was pulling it out of the case.

Little update here...  Today I finally had the time to take the statues completely out of the box.. and as others are saying..  LOCKE is completely off his base.  For the price, I'll be sending mine back, they can replace or refund.. their call.  Surely not worth the $250.00 price tag.

To charge $250.00 for a collector's and not even offer a physical copy of the game is well, just plain stupid.  I personally don't have a problem downloading the game but seriously...  250.00 and no physical copy.

In my opinion, this is the worst limited collector's I've bought, and I just expected more quality on the statue part..

Also, some have said that you can send in the download code in for a physical copy, some have even linked to a site supported by halowaypoint.com.

My Xbox One worked 100% fine on 02/19/16. On 02/02/16 I downloaded a game from XBox Marketplace (CoD: BO3). After downloading the game, it refused to open. Then, all my digital purchased games on Xbox ceased working (My disks work fine). I contacted Microsoft support, and spent approx 6 hrs troubleshooting. It ended with ""We don't have a solution, sorry. Looks like the marketplace download broke your console. AT least you can use disks right? Tough luck on the digital downloads you paid for and can't access anymore"". Then they asked for 130 bucks for me to pay them to fix my Xbox, after their service caused the issues.

Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...

What EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:

- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players
- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)
- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements
- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)
- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)
- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)
- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)
_ Throw-ins are just a joke! Players spend most of the time running after the ball themselves as if there's no one out there

Overall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.

After all, it's EA and they sure know how to be the winner of ""Worst Company of the Year"" for 2 years in a row. If you haven't purchased the game yet, don't buy it. It's just a waste of time and money...",One of the wors FIFA games ever,1383350400,18,,

Really EA, really? How stupid do you think your customers are? The world is extremely small, there is a loading screen between EVERY lot, even your neighbors lot.

I wanted to try it on PC and found it for a reasonable price, so I pulled the trigger.

Well, there went $10 down the drain.

The game loaded up just fine and it's a beautiful looking game provided you're absolutely stationary. Once you hit the gas, the game becomes unplayable. The stuttering was so, so bad. I was probably getting 15 frames per second, if that. What was more puzzling was the number of invisible walls I ran into. When training as a cop I was tasked with a rapid response. I was moving along at 15 frames per second when suddenly my car just stopped moving (it happened at the same place on the map with a racer car as well). The timer in the top right corner continued to run, the trees keep moving, the engine was still roaring, but I was completely still for a good forty seconds. If it happens once, you can deal with it, but it happened multiple times.

It's a bummer because I enjoy the franchise. I just wonder if the Frostbite engine is the right way to go. For my money Hot Pursuit looks just as good and that game came out nearly five years ago.

As other reviewers noted, the mouse did not come with all items listed in the description, but the packaging was neat. The software is very limited, and all but worthless. The mouse looked like a good ergonomic mouse, however once I held this for the first time I knew it wasn't going to work well for gaming or any longer than 5 minutes of use. That was the case once I sat down and used it, my wrist started to feel strained after the first 15 minutes. The problem is there is nowhere for your pinkie to rest, unless you use it with your index finger and middle finger on the left & right, and place your ring finger on the 2 top right side buttons. Using it this way you loose allot of control, and for gaming is unusable.

Something the item description lists is that this mouse has a 1 Ghz Frequency polling rate. An obvious oversight in whoever wrote this; as mouse polling rate is usually measured in hertz (hz) and this was listed in Gigahertz (Ghz) and 1Ghz equals 1000000000hz. I believe they were trying to convey a 1000hz polling rate for the mouse. I used Mouse Rate to test the response time and on average measured 450hz, with peaks in the 550 range. Which is still a very good response rate but not the 1000hz listed in the item description. I found no way to modify this in the software.

The last straw for me on this mouse was during use. I loaded up CS:GO and went into the workshop crosshair select v2 which will allow you to try out different crosshairs, and test using them on some bots which do some basic strafing. When I got into the firing range I like to test accuracy by aiming about 90 degrees away, snapping to them and try for headshots. WHEN THE MOUSE IS MOVED AT A FAST RATE IT CUTS OUT! ..... Would make it to about the 90 degrees and stop moving! I thought maybe it was just something with the DPI/CPI setting (800 at the time) so I kicked it up through all levels, and found it to happen on all settings. After this find I unplugged the mouse, put it back in the box, and filed a return for refund.

In conclusion, I know what is listed on paper in combination with it's price point sounds attractive, but the mouse just fails to deliver on all fronts. Not sure what Sentey was thinking with this one, as in my experience they generally make a great products. The mouse I received was more than likely defective, but with the ergonomics also in mind, I could not use this mouse, and would suggest regardless of hand size, that you look elsewhere for a mouse for any application.

Side Note: Before this was even picked up for refund, I ordered the Steelseries Rival. Would heavily suggest check it out.",Avoid this mouse,1437091200,,,

1.0,False,"06 4, 2009",A2QW0UAI35BO9S,B001EM1DK4,Luk3,"The Sims 2 was a direct, undeniable sequel to the Sims that took everything from the base Sims game and added onto it. The Sims 3 feels much less like a direct sequel but an off-shoot of the series, more like a console version of the game but done right.

That said, considering the new gameplay experiences the game itself as a new incarnation of the Sims would be good but I can't help but feel there is much missing from the previous version.

For starters, you're buying a game with content withheld. You don't have a hot tub or even that many appealing hairstyles because EA decided to withhold these items from the game to coerce you to spend more money immediately after purchasing the game on their website. Additionally, you aren't only unnecessarily spending money for content that should've shipped with the game but you are forced to install the EA Download Manager which is how EA will infect your computer with their invasive Securom virus. While some may argue this unfair practice is A-okay, it's not, and as a consumer you should be appalled and find this absolutely unacceptable.

Secondly, the create-a-sim is extremely disappointing. Based on the ground game of S2 and S3 I found the customization tool in 2 to be far more advanced allowing greater customization. I'm sure in time as the community releases custom content we may have a greater degree of power in customizing our Sims to our likings but from the getgo I found the Sims 2 to be far superior. The only real improvement with 3 is the personalities and how we can tailor them.

Thirdly, the UI... I find the UI to be extremely tacky looking and I loathe the way the job requirements look (A smiley face, for reals?!!?). I can't help but feel EA has undermined the intelligence of those of us who play The Sims. When I first went into Buy mode I was taken aback by how the items are listed by ""room"" but fortunately you can switch to a category view, however, in Build mode you cannot... The listing of categories in Build mode is little pictures of the wall/fence/roof/etc... Very tacky and annoying and an insult to the intelligence of Sims players.

Less Realistic: Sims no longer visit the fridge to get a baby bottle, they magically swipe it from behind their back and diapers magically vanish in thin air... Rather upsetting at first but considering you can take your baby around town it makes sense (You don't want diapers all over the streets). However, you can call a repairman at any time and he'll be over within an hour. In previous Sims he'll be over the next day which is far more realistic. Children also can't call for repairs or even delivery anymore.

The graphics are far less realistic as well. I feel the Sims look very cartoony as does the entire town in comparison to the Sims 2. In 2 everything looked far more detailed and realistic where as in 3 it looks cartoony, dumbed down and far less realistic. Back to customizing your character, it's impossible to get a decently built male Sim without an oversize neck and it's impossible to get a female Sim with a proportionate bust-size without being obese, this was not the case in 2.

Overall I'm extremely disappointed in the game as I can't help but feel they took away too much. The only obvious improvement is the open town and the personalities but it certainly doesn't make up for what is missing. Also, the heinous practices of EA are unacceptable. Withholding content to charge consumers after paying a premium price (Would be okay if there was a price break in the game itself but at the regular price... No). Also, if you have to do reinstalls good luck trying to replace whatever you bought from EA's store, it's never as simple as claimed.

I would probably issue this game a 2 or 3 star rating but considering all the kool-aid drinkers that are just going to 5 star it blindly I'd prefer to even out the rating some. Nonetheless, the actions of EA easily warrant no stars or a call to boycott until it hits the sales bin.

It should also be known you can only have ONE active household in your town. You can switch to another home but it's almost like having to remove the battery from your cell phone just to switch memory cards, a hassle. You also lose wishes/promises when you switch so it's not at all as easy as it should be.

BUGS: I've experienced two freezes where I had to manually turn off my computer and one crash to desktop, all three incidents were pretty much isolated and not something I would say I fear from the game as I do believe they were attributed to a particular driver that when changed seemed to have resolved the problem.

There is an issue in sound, major issue. For one, 5.1 does not work, at least not for me. I get sound out of the three front speakers, mostly the middle, and that's it. Only when switching to stereo or using my speakers upmixing do I get ""surround"" which then sounds crappy. Also, an even greater issue, the music in Buy and Build mode sometimes does not play whatsoever which makes you feel very lonely and empty when building/decorating. An even greater issue is the sound cutting out when in Live mode. There are times when two Sims are talking and their voices just cut out and it takes some dramatic maneuvering of the camera to hear them again... It's extremely annoying.

I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs and don't believe I will as I find myself pretty bored by this game already but what I did encounter is just annoying at best and hopefully will be resolved by a patch.","Not Really A Sequel, Many Disappointments",1244073600,25,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

I loved this game, I've played it for over 224 hours, the game suddenly began crashing every time I played, making the game unplayable.

I haven't even touched the expansions because I wanted to make sure I took my time, what a huge mistake that was.

Anyway, a month or two ago the game started crashing anytime I interacted with a merchant. Now the game crashes after playing for 15-20 minutes or anytime I interact with an NPC. Rendering the game unplayable.

 I've reported the 38+ crashes to PSN and have contacted CD Projekt Red and WB games. After looking online, I found multiple people posting back over a year who have the exact same issue.

CD Projekt Red suggested making sure I had the latest updates (I did), uninstalling and reinstalling (I did, on different HDs even), reverting back to my earliest save (no change). After explaining this, the person I was emailing with suggested deleting my saves and starting over, throwing away 224+ hours of my life because they could care less about fixing a game that everyone's already given them their money for. Complete garbage way of handling this, no understanding or sympathizing with my situation at all.

This is so disappointing for many reasons, the first being that this game is universally beloved by everyone, including me before it broke.

The second reason being I truely believed that CD Projekt Red was different from the other developers, even if WB was publishing it. Then I saw how poorly they were rated by current and past employees on GlassDoor, even worse than EA, shockingly.

If/when the game is fixed & had the customer/tech support had seemed to care or empathize at all, this would be a 5 star game. As of today (10/1/17) this game is zero stars, it did nothing but take up space on my hard drive since it became completely unplayable, so I've deleted it.

Hopefully enough people will speak up when/if this happens to them and CD Projekt Red will be forced to patch/fix their broken game. As of right now, I've never wished PSN gave refunds more..

1.0,False,"11 28, 2005",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0009Z3HXI,Tsanche,"The only true crime here is the shoddy work done on this title.  True Crimes: Streets of LA was like many Grand Theft Auto rip offs.  Big city, plenty of running around to do.  Except instead of working for the mob or whatever, you're actually a cop.  It may not have been the best game, but it was a start.  Some of the mechanics weren't bad.  Some were actually fairly well done.  I guess one could only expect a sequel.  In hopes that True Crimes: New York City would be better, I seem to have had my hopes up.

You play as Marcus Reed, a gangster who has just become a cop so he can clean up the streets of New York.  And as Marcus you'll take on the assignments given to you by the police department.  They're all pretty straightforward.  Each mission is divided into parts.  Each part consists of you gunning down all the thugs, and finding the bad guy.  Rinse and repeat.  The missions, like Streets of LA, are very simple and don't really call for any real strategy at all.  And the bad guys are as stereotypical as the main character himself.

The game is pretty simple, and should you only do the missions, you'll complete it in fairly short time.  The same thing plagued the first True Crimes game, and I was hoping there would be an improvement here.  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.

If you don't want to do the main mission though, there are alternatives.  Much like GTA there are side missions you can do.  You can street race, go off and stop other crimes, and you can frisk people for contraband, including drugs, obscene pictures, weapon parts, stolen license plates... and the list goes on.  You can either turn these things into the station for Career Points, which help your rank.

There are five ranks in True Crimes 2, and they're all based on whether or not you're a good cop or a bad cop.  Unfortunately, there's nothing special about the ranking system until you become an extremely bad cop, and that will overall lower your ranking.

Being a good cop simply means you've taken the proper precautions such as frisking your suspects, clipping them in cuffs and not killing anyone needlessly.  Bad cops are obtained the exact opposite way.  It's a lot easier to be a bad cop than a good cop, but it is still one of the points of True Crimes that sticks out as being plesant.  You just won't notice until you're an extremely bad cop, or an extremely good cop.

The gameplay is simple.  You shoot or strike down your enemies to death.  You can lock on to them, but for some reason Marcus isn't always accurate in doing so.  You can also pick up weapons your enemies drop but there isn't much variety in them, and in the end you'll most likely find yourself picking them up because you're low on ammo in one weapon, so you need more.

Melee combat isn't bad.  You'll probably only do it because it looks cool, but it's almost suicide in some cases.  You can pick up objects and lug them at your enemies and whatnot.  You can also snap their necks if you're good enough, or throw them up against the wall.  There's a lot of variety there.  Hey, you can even do it to random pedestrians, but it isn't much fun (especially when they, for whatever reason, don't die).

The vehicles you drive around in are pretty realistic, based off of real cars, but you can't help but look at how messed up some of these mechanics are.  A slight tap on another car will send it flying into traffic, without a doubt.  It doesn't matter what the car is, it sends it out there!  You'll also run into a moment or two of floating cars, and that's another of many bugs this game has.

There are more bugs than one can imagine.  For example, you may just randomly fall through the ground into eternal darkness.  You'll eventually die, but you'll wish you hadn't stepped on the crack when you do.  Some of the scripted moments for whatever reason just stop, cars changing colors... the list goes on and on and on.

Surely the graphics will save this game right?  Naw, and if you think they do, something is seriously wrong with you.  This isn't up to the standards of this generation at all.  The character models are blockier than a cube of ice, and the framerate is terrible.  Every five seconds or so the game will freeze and then resume.  This very apparent when you're roaming the streets of New York.  In the indoor areas it's less frequent, but you'll lose several boss fights because of that.  The game freezes for that brief moment, but the action does not.  Not only that, but sometimes the sound will cut out.

As far as the music goes, it really isn't too bad. You can rank your songs so that the ones you want to play actually play, and if there's a song you completely hate, you can rank it a zero and it'll never play.

The voice acting isn't bad.  Christopher Walken lends his voice, but sometimes the celebrity voice actors feel like a waste.  Especially with the poorly written script.  Now, I can be a good sport about cusswords, but not when they're used as senselessly as this.  They come as sounding like little middle school kids saying these words just to ""be cool"" rather than to be serious or tough.

Truthfully, I think this is a game that isn't worth getting.  Way too many bugs, the game is short, the dialogue is bad, is there really any reason to want to get ths game?  Even the graphics lack.  This isn't worth your time.  Even if you like True Crimes: Streets of LA this just isn't worth your time.

Did this game have potential? Absolutely. It had massive potential. The characters look nice and cartoon-like, there are more than 8, and you could play online at one point. But what is a game if the game play is less than sub-par?

The amount of content in this game is extremely lacking. You can win a few new characters but that's about it. There is a challenge mode but you must beat 22 people in 250 seconds. Those 2 things are your main things you can do in this game. As far as characters, you start out with Ken, Ryu, Bison, Sagat, Zangief, and Balrog... I mean who else does anyone care about in the SF universe enough to buy a game just to play them?

The fighting is somewhat fun but it has so many flaws it is ridiculous. The CPU you fight has what I like to term Metaknowledge where you can be inputting your Haduken buttons and already the computer is lifting up, coming down with an attack to dodge your fire ball and hit you in a combo that takes half of your life.

When you jump to kick someone, they can break from anything they are doing (anything) no matter how complex and stop to hit you out of the air because their timing is so precise you can't walk up to them, you can't jump to them and come down with an attack, and out of the blue if you are able to get in an attack from jumping it will be blocked, the bottom kick will be blocked, and you will be countered with a grab.

Metaknowledge in video games irks me to no end. The AI can hit you no matter what you are doing but they will dodge and block anything you do. Not only that, they will counter you with a 5 hit combo and top it off with their special move which they seem to charge up much faster than you. Pretty much 15 seconds and you're toast.

My main beef with the game is if you can get past all of the metaknowledge the game has, the last boss battle is against a creature named Seth. He is pretty much like the wooden guy from Tekken in that he is a mix of all characters in one. He can teleport, he can stretch his limbs out, he can shoot things at you, he can and will combo you like crazy. He will do the thing where he stands there until you are JUST at the nanosecond of standing up and he will attack you mercilessly to knock you down in which the cycle will repeat itself. He will counter any inch of a move you make and hit you with about 5-10 hits in each counter. Even on ""Very Easy"" he is still a struggle. So much so that there are videos online showing how you can turn the game on the easiest mode just to beat him.

Is that really how you want to remember a street fighter game? Where God willing you make it to the last boss you need to have it on the easiest mode you can have it on just to be able to stand a chance? So you have unenjoyable and frustrating fighting, a major lack of content, and a lack of reason to play as you will just be trolled like some bad joke the developers threw in for a final boss fight no matter what character you are playing with.

1.0,True,"06 8, 2013",AOSS0QH4CBPEW,B000P46NMA,Mr. White,"4 frowns for AC III :( :( :( :( and 5 frowns for Ubisoft for letting it happen. When I play this game it's almost like a mysterious invisible hand is there holding my assassin avatar back from completing kills and other achievements. This was an awful game for the price I paid and I'm sure glad I did not spend $59.99. Some things are nice about the game like petting domestic animals and that works very well, plus these animals get in your way when looting the dead people you just killed.  Buy this game just to do the Naval Missions because I think that's the best part of the game and everything else in the game is kinda flaky. I suppose this is the funny part of the game, funny meaning strange not humorous at all. Sometimes I want to throw up when I'm playing this game because the malfunctions are that bad. I guess I can laugh about it a little since just watching the game fail while playing becomes almost laughable. I think Assassin's Creed Revelations is a better game than this one. For one, Ezio has the Hook Blade a really nice feature with zipline kills and two, knife throwing, plus I think combos in Revelations are way better to. In Revelations, you can disarm, throw weapons, chop and shoot people up way better. I am certain this games STINKS!!! I think Mr. Ubisoft rushed the AC III product to market because some things in the game are half baked and not completely done.

I guess the biggest thing so far is having to look at the screen very intensely that results in quite a lot of eye strain. I have played only 1 sequence and part of sequence 2 already and my neck hurts really bad and my eyes are very tired from trying to see what the avatars are doing. I adjusted the screen texture brightness and contrast as much as possible and still the colors are very dark making it difficult to distinguish the field of play. So I can hardly see the game 1/2 of the time.. Still, I am going to give this game some more time just to see if I have misjudged my 1st impression. Plus the game has malfunctioned more than once and I am sure that the malfunction is a gaming malfunction not a player malfunction. I hope Black Flag is better because I think this one kinda blows and stinks. As far as I know there is no knife throwing either which is kinda important to long range silent kills. It seems like the game makers decided to produce a game that is a kiddie sissy game with blood gore.

Okay I am almost through sequence 2 now and the game seems like its turning around and starting to work the way it should. Why? Who knows? For instance when I first picked up a British rifle I choose to use it against the enemy at the gate in the first engagement scene (where Hayman gets the chest) and this did not and would not work for me (I attempted this more than once). However during sequence 2 this worked at the British Fort to free the prisoners. There are other malfunctions like key people missing to complete acts of eavesdropping or other optional goals that are important to completing the memories. I expect to see more of these glitches while playing the game.

Also I noticed hardly no enemy intelligence collecting or any such acts which is probably the most important information to get to do missions except for eavesdropping. So the whole idea of defeating the enemy revolves around eavesdropping? I am sure during this time people could be bought for a price or coerced into working for someone else other than the British. Ultimately, there were double agents to because that was part of surviving during this time. A double agent(s) could have been produced or imagined from French and other European immigrants that were persecuted for their religious beliefs during this time frame to. So there is an Assassin network but not really a spy network yet. I am waiting for someone to be hung or something like this because in the Ezio episodes this motivated Ezio to seek revenge on characters in the game.

This game really really stinks and the avatars are so PATHETIC! For instance, in sequence 7 you do some stealth missions that are almost impossible to master because of the avatar. The enemy sees Conner always and he can not call other Assassins for help or distractions. I have yet to complete a memory without something going haywire for Hayman or crashing for Conner. Everytime the targeting mechanism gets conjumbled up and then the game goes into a continuous loop of malfunctions and won't work over and over again. This game sucks there is no doubt about and I don't care what anybody else says. Ubisoft needs to redo there ultimate new invention because something is broken about it, end of story.

1.0,False,"11 23, 2012",A6XGIW9KSC0Y1,B004YVOCV4,Washuai,"Unfinished, buggy, and unsupported. I can't believe I preordered this game; big mistake. But AC was (sort of is, in spite of everything) my favorite PS3 series.

It was fun, until 18 hours in at memory 4.  Then it started freezing and crashing. Then it crashed during a save and I had to start over. This kind of crap, is why I gave up on the Sims franchise.

Being forced to back up saves and replay, just to complete the game is just taking away any fun I am having. I haven't spoiled myself, but it doesn't even sound like this torture is worth the story based on reviews that didn't give away what they were disappointed with.

I gave Ubisoft support a chance and they ignored all my questions about the freezing and just focused on yes, the save is corrupt; you'll have to start over, ticket closed. They opted for silence - 3 strikes. Some honest acknowledgement and letting me know they aren't going to fix it, would at least renew a smidgen of goodwill. At least make me not feel like a chump owning ACIII, which at least I know wasn't a one year rush cash grab and has support. This issue was reported months ago by other players, so I doubt it is going to be fixed.

I've tried deleting all game data and starting fresh, while playing offline - still eventually starts freezing and Ezio/PS3 become unresponsive. When it happens during an autosave, then you better have a backup, because it is now over and that save will load to freeze.

I don't know how to revert my PS3 xmb to before 4.0, to see if that helps. I only have this problem with this game.

I've read the other bug reports. One year, was clearly not enough time. Why this game was so much harder for them to keep clean, compared to Brotherhood, I don't know.

Right now, I'm just playing to see credits and my patience ended.  I am stupid, since I not only preordered AC III, but have now bought AC Liberations Vita bundle.  This is more like mixed signals that will only encourage their bad behavior (and my disappointment).  That's two chances and a lot of money, I'm sure Ubisoft does not deserve.  Clearly, I'm addicted.

I guess there isn't any series I am going to routinely preorder, anymore, thanks to a lack of quality. It isn't like I've never played and still loved a buggy game (Red Dead Redemption).

That said, the game itself is unfinished, the Desmond grey room tell, no show monologues are tortuous, too. All the different elements of the game, don't integrate well. Some enemies get stuck. Given the frustration, I'm not adding trophies and complete collection.

I see complaints about consequences for not being a stealthy assassin.  Challenge is good and fun in my books and if I want to be impatient and rash, I don't mind the game responding in kind, but I prefer to feel I've earned something, rather than empty instant gratification.  Really, it is too easy still to lose your maximum alert level and even at your max, things are never intense the way they are in say, a GTA game, when you're most wanted. Without the bugs, I think a fun replay would have been no players, maximum mayhem, high costs and few reprieves. If they'd made the game too have your cake and eat it, then that wouldn't be an option. It is more realistic if you're brazen, to be brazenly hunted and to have to pay more at shops. It is kind of cheap that there's basically all or nothing and the all isn't even that crazy in AC:R.
The distance is quickly covered and as long as you don't rob the Herald and just run back and forth, you can take down 100% notoriety in less a minute. But if you're that high, you get a close-by official to kill and often stalkers. That's really easy. Notoriety/ Templar Awareness isn't balanced. There are not levels and it increases very quickly and goes away just as easily, so it just feels like non-rewarding busy work.

Den defense in and of itself, isn't really that fun. Mostly because it is basically one strategy that works without any subtlety and you need to get the hang of the cannon. But you don't have to take towers, renovate, etc. So early on you have to play it safe, place your master assassins, and earn your right to go on crazy killing sprees with fewer consequences to avoid den defense. Raising master assassins to permanently defend the dens, seems to be a contributing factor to my freeze issues, though.

Without the game halting bugs, I would have rated I liked it, even with Desmond torture, lack of cohesion, story issues, other bugs, etc.
I'm frustrated, disappointed and angry. I play games to relax and have fun, and this is none of that.  This game isn't worth it free, as it causes freezing that force you to reboot your PS3.  This would have been 4 stars, if they patched this buggy *bleep*.

I'm not a fan of the show, but post-zombie apocalypse settings are always a big draw for me in a video game.  I've been too busy with life and other games to buy this game, and now I'm glad I didn't.  As I write this, the first episode is free to download on Xbox Live.  Free is always good, especially for a game you're not sure of, so I gave it a try.

I want back the hour of my life I wasted on this game.

First, this isn't a game.  It is an interactive movie.  It is one of those inane ""push the right button when it flashes on the screen"" snooze fests.  It is about 90% cut scenes with the occasional button push.  If you like CoD type games or open worlds, you will HATE this ""game"".

Second, even for the genre it is terrible.  The game has two modes: 1) an easy mode where it gives you hints about what is expected of you; and 2) a hard mode where there few if any hints.  Not knowing what to expect, I opted for the hint mode.  I would have actually been better off going it on my own.

The first time this barely interactive cartoon lets you do anything, you have to get out of a car, get off your handcuffs, and deal with a cop-turned-zombie.  After you have crawled to where your back is up against a police car, the screen starts flashing ""look at cop"".  Ok, I look at the cop.  The character says something and the zombie keeps coming.  So I look at cop again.  Same result.  The screen says again ""look at cop"".  So I look at the cop again.  And he jumps on me and eats my brains -- ""You are dead"" says the game.  After it reloads, when it tells me to look at the cop, I DON'T look at the cop, but look to my right and left and find a shotgun with a shell.  Then I get to shoot the zombie.  So what you actually have to do is the exact opposite of what the hint on the screen is blaring at you to do.

And this is the VERY FIRST TIME you interact with the game.  It does not get any better.  I thought this style of game went out of vogue 30 years ago with the old Dragon's Lair quarter eater of the 80s.  Sadly, it appears that this particular developer is going retro.

I PROMISE you that you will thank me for it.  If you buy this game you will be throwing away money that could be used to actually satisfy your Walking Dead fix and entertain you.

Today's experience with Microsoft has been an absolute eye opener as far as the quality of their products and their complete lack of service overall.  I have had my 360 system for a few years and bought the elite and newer models of the systems to avoid the problems that everyone else was experiencing with their consoles.  This morning I went to turn on my 360 to experience the dreaded red ring of death that I have heard about so many times from so many of my friends.  So I called Microsoft to see if I can have it repaired only to get the answer that my warranty had expired mere days ago.  They did however offer to repair the system for half the price of a brand new system ($100 the new xbox 360 being released in a month retails at $199) with no mention of an upgraded warranty after this one would have gotten fixed.  Naturally I decided to decline especially since I had a backup system upstairs (my fiancee's).  I got to play one game for about a half hour and decided to switch to a different game, low and behold a second system broken in one day, this time the drive door would not open, not to worry this system was made later and should still be under warranty right?  WRONG, the answer the technician gave me for this system is because this is a different problem the warranty does not count for as long, so essentially two broken systems in one day.  Please be VERY CAUTIOUS when buying any products from Microsoft in the future.","Good When They Work, Microsoft's product service does not help",1287792000,96,,

The graphics were terrible, even for playstation, the difficulty was ridiculous and through the roof, your teammates were slow and stupid and the enemies all shot far more accurately then you could.

The difficulty was even backward, from everything I have read on the game- easy was hard and hard was easy. It was like the game wasn't even finished.

Now the game might not be that bad if it just let you relax and stealth through a mission. But, no, every map has an absurdly short timer, forcing you to run headlong from start to finish, shooting wildly at everything around you, trying to get to the end before your team gets slaughtered or the time runs out.

I only ever managed to beat the first mission once- and im pretty good at shooter games- but the second mission was only that much worse.

I have a rule, that I keep every game I own (rather then trading it in) forever and ever because you never know when one day you might want to go back and play it again. This is probably the only game I've ever owned that broke that rule. When I think of what the worst game I ever played was, this is usually what comes to mind.

The sound was terrible, the graphics were terrible, the controls were terrible, the difficulty was terrible, the TIMER was terrible, what little I seen of the AI was not impressive- teammates killing themselves like always- and even the lighting was terrible, forcing you to stare at this strange vista of green and black all the time.

You want a playstation one stealth shooter? Try Metal Gear Solid, or syphon filter, or anything. Anything at all.

Please, I'm warning you, don't buy this game. Not even for 1 dollar, because it will only tempt you into the torture of playing it. You will get far more pleasure out a dollar double cheeseburger anyhow.",I'm warning you,1265414400,,,
1.0,False,"02 15, 2010",A3RWG8GN7XHBKL,B000FKBCX4,Katie,"I am up to the civilization stage right now. This game sounded so cool when I heard about it. The notion of evolution is so complex and could make for a really smart, engaging game. Unfortunately, this game is just too simple and is comprised of monotonous mouse clicks and very little thinking. I don't see how it is replayable for an adult. You can just do the same thing everytime. I think kids, however, would enjoy this game.

I've played an aggressive game. I'm not sure what the herbivore/friendly gameplay is like, but when you do combat, you run around and click a button to attack enemies who are lower ranked than you. If they are higher ranked, you avoid them. It actually reminded me slightly of World of Warcraft, you run around with the camera behind you and click buttons for corresponding attacks. The ""grind"" of killing X number of enemies is the worst part of WoW and is featured in this game, in an even more boring, less thought-required way. For all the talk of the great graphics in Spore from people, I have to say I don't see it. The landscapes are the same all over and not very detailed.

When it comes to evolving, calling it evolution is deceiving. Evolving means existing characteristics should change a little to give you more abilities, based on the abilities you need. In this game, you can scrap everything about your creature and start from scratch everytime it ""evolves."" There's not any strategy planning ahead needed. It can have six legs or two, doesn't matter. It just comes down to the stats associated with each attribute. Evolution, if I understand science, should arise out of outside forces... changes in the geography, weather, enemies species, etc. You can just do whatever you want in this game willy nilly with no consequence.

In tribal mode, you just collect food, make babies and then attack neighboring tribes. It really requires zero thought. Your enemies aren't very bright and there's not much you need to keep track of other than food.

I think the overall concept for the game is great, but the execution just isn't there. I think Will Wright and EA focus too much on making ""simple games"" that anyone can play without much of a learning curve. This is a problem. A game that requires no learning curve requires no thought and will get old quickly. A game like Civilization 4 is probably downright overwhelming for a new player, but I don't think you'll find a more addictive, replayable game. Will Wright and EA seem to want their games to be easy simple as Brick Breaker -- well, I'm not paying $50 to play Brick Breaker and unless I'm waiting in a doctor's office playing on my phone, I'm not going to replay Brick Breaker for weeks, months or years. Spore is stale within a day. The Sims was another great concept and was an alright game, but lacked the depth and complexity to make it a truly great game. SimCity could have so many layers and levels of engagement. I don't know why EA and Will Wright are so reluctant to make these games all they could be.

Oh, and about the DRM issue everyone whines about: You can download this game illegally and be playing within a couple hours (depending on your download speeds). There's no point in trying to prevent piracy. You can get the Sims 3 and SimCity 4 illegally too. I promise. These companies just shoot themselves in the foot.","So boring. Super boring!

So if you buy this game, be aware that you'll be limited to 3 or 5 activations and then you'll have to call Electronic Arts at your expense if you want to install it again. Your expense is currently about $[...]/minute in the US, check EA's support page for your rate if you don't line in the US. Say you sit on hold and get the call done in ten minutes. There goes another $[...] to play a game you supposedly already own!

What is an activation? Install the game, that's an activation. Change a piece of hardware, that uses an activation. Reinstall Windows without changing any hardware, that uses up an activation. You might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver. Adding a USB peripheral device could use up an activation. You get 5 of these, then the game ceases to function and you'll get a message saying that you need to buy a new copy (not call them for more activations as it should say).

SecuROM has been known to give users errors or not allow an installation to occur due to CD/DVD drive incompatibility problems (usually older drives). You will typically get CRC or checksum errors while a file is being read from the drive. SecuROM also maintain a ""black list"" of processes where it won't allow the game to run if you have one of these black listed programs installed or running.

SecuROM is just plain bad news for the honest customer and to make matters worse it hasn't had much impact on piracy at all. In fact, the pirates enjoy greater freedom and far less headaches than the honest customer. Spore is a great example of why SecuROM is bad all the way around.

For more info, search google or wiki for SecuROM, there's lots of info out there.

I loved Civ II (on my first computer) and Civ III.  Alpha Centauri was great!
Civ IV was not really an improvement although the graphics were nice. All these games grabbed me.  It was always, ""Just one more turn!""

Now let me say:  Graphics are nice but some of the best computer games have had lousy graphics (or none at all!)

Civ V was apparently designed by the marketing department at Firaxis.  It was reviewed in computer magazines who wanted to cash in on the advertising.  Anyone who wrote a good review of this coot (it doesn't deserve to be rated a turkey!) probably got paid to do so.

It took forever to install, and took two tries to complete. It crashed the first time.

When I tried to play the cursor got lost and didn't point to where it was supposed to.  The game crashed so often I started saving after ever turn.  It took so long to build improvements that I wanted to reduce the population to slavery.  Apparently they had all gone to work for Firaxis and spent most of their time on office politics instead of production.

Sloooow, slooooow, crash. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I have seen this happen before. Someone writes a very good game that is immensely successful.  Then there is a sequel that works well, because it tweaks some of the weaknesses of the first.  But as the thing grows the bean counters and marketing departments take over from the creative people.  Marketing likes graphics (They don't know squat about games!) and so the game becomes nearly unplayable and more aggravating than fun.

About 9 months ago, I witnessed a 20 minute demo of the game...and it looked good.  What happened in the interim is simply explained by a seemingly well-polished game upstaged by marketing and extra effort put into a demo.

First of all, sound.  Yes, it's a strange place to start, but it's the thing that bothers me the most.  We first get a video summary from Corporal Hicks (from Aliens, of course) basically summarizing the survivors of the fated excursion to rescue colonists on LV426.  His voice is loaded with static and faint; very appropriate.  Then, you hear a typical pep talk from your CO...AND WHY AM I STILL LISTENING TO STATIC?!?  HE'S IN FRONT OF ME FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!  Then, however, the sound rights itself...sort of.  The musical score is underwhelming and sounds like it's coming from my bedroom with the door closed.  The gunfire (while authentically sounding like the movie) sounds like it was recorded from the original VHS soundtrack as opposed to the remastered sound that you hear on the Blu-Ray version of the movie.  Sound is just extremely unbalanced throughout and it's distracting.  I don't fault my sound system - I've been pretty happy with my Pioneer Elite and just listening to the thundering soundtrack on Inception was enough to put my fears to ease that my sound system was NOT the cause.

The good.  I enjoy the gameplay immensely.  It's not frightening, but it's fun.  IGN and other game reviewers have noted that the AI blindly charges you.  Well...yes and no.  Sometimes Aliens just run right at me but I have found areas where I find them scrambling across walls and ceilings to avoid my fire.  It's not entirely accurate that the AI is completely mindless.  The guns themselves range quite a bit in variety and follows an old Doom style sort of inventory management (of course I can carry 9 guns!!!).  You'll find that some weapons are worthless (powerful, but with a very low rate of fire) whilst others, like Hicks' famed shotgun which shows up as one of several ""legendary"" weapons, are more useful than their standard variants and finding them is half the reward of playing.

The not so good:  story.  I was wondering how Aliens:  Colonial Marines was going to tie into the sequel.  The Sulaco was spotted over Fury 161 (a nod to Alien 3) and then somehow reappears over LV426.  How does this happen, asks one inquisitive soldier??  Well, heck, we don't know but we don't care, so let's start the story shall we?  Oh, and there are Weyland-Yutani mercenaries on the ship for some reason!  By the way...remember that atmosphere-processing plant that went thermo-nuclear in a cloud supposedly the ""size of Nebraska?""  Well, make that a family living room in Nebraska since one of the walls in Operations at Hadley's Hope suffered massive damage...and it might have knocked over a chair or two.  It certainly didn't take out Hadley's Hope.  There are certain gameplay elements that are frustrating as well.  I held my breath when I jumped into the claw-armed loader...and expelled it in disappointment.  The controls for it are clunky and I feel like I'm taking rapid baby-steps in the dang thing as opposed to the more powerful, slow lumbering walks that I'm used to seeing in the movie.  They simply got it WRONG.

Graphically, it's sad.  Very, very sad.  When you look at games like Uncharted or Dead Space 3 (running at 1080p!) and marvel at how something could look so beautiful without tearing or framerate hiccups, one has to wonder how something that looks about as advanced as Doom 3 could tear and suffere framerate hiccups like this game does.  I don't judge a book entirely by its cover, mind you, but this is bordering on the ""frustratingly distracting"" when it happens.  It's also inconsistent - some areas look decent and then you wonder where that polish went in the next area.  Sadder still is that the PC game appears to have received the best treatment while the console ports seem to be a poorly developed afterthought.  Again, keeping in mind how good Uncharted and Dead Space 3 look...why oh why couldn't they have done a better job?

But why do I love it so much?  It truly boils down to this - nostalgia.  This is the Aliens game I WISHED had come out as a movie game back in the late 80's...and the gameplay isn't too bad.  In 2013, however, it is a letdown simply because it could have been capable of so much more.  At $29 or less, I would say that it's worth a spin.  At full price, however, this is an insult.  Even though it may have been outsourced, Gearbox should NOT have slapped their name on this; this is not the quality of game that I would want my company name saddled with on my resume.

UPDATE
------
I completed the game as I progressively became more and more disenchanted with it.  In the end, I had to downgrade the score overall since the game just kept getting WORSE.

MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD

The final ""boss fight"" (and I use the term ""fight"" very, very loosely) involves the Queen (surprise).  But rather than it being a drawn out slug-fest, she is apparently immune to all forms of weaponry (hell, even ""10mm rounds...explosive tips, caseless"" don't really matter, right?).  So what does this final fight involve?  Well, it involves moving around a U-shaped room with conveniently placed (allegedly strewn wreckage caused by the Marine's air transport slamming into the side of a Weyland-Yutani ship to escape LV-426) cargo containers with openings that allow you to hit 4 switches to prep a ""cargo launcher.""  Before you start into a series of laughing fits, think about this:  1) why would anyone create a cargo system that requires you to go to 4 rather inconveniently placed switches for such a system and...well, let me get to 2) in a second.  So once the launcher is prepped, you have to ""lure"" the Queen in front of the launcher so you can hit the switch.  Now I get to 2).  Who designs a cargo launcher that apparently looks like it was designed to jettison something as heavy as about 4 or 5 semis through the hold at over 100 mph at the door opening?!?  Yes, you hit the Queen with this monstrosity and then you're greeted with someone who looks like Bishop but it's actually Weyland himself...or is it?!?  This insipidly stupid ending treats us to the Bishop with the Marines plugging into the dead android imposter with our main character, Winter, saying, ""Did we get anything Bishop?  We really need a win here?""  ""We got everything.""  Roll credits.  WHAT?!?!??!??

In addition to a stupid ending, we are treated during the course of the story to an attempt to save one of your squadmate's life because she has an Alien in her...but we knew where this was going.  Ultimately, I think that I was supposed to shed a tear, but I found myself groaning inwardly, ""Get on with it"" as the cutscene played out.

As far as the story, the veering off from story canon does actually get worse.  We are treated with Corporal Hicks...alive!  But Hicks, weren't you found dead in the escape unit on Fury?  ""Well, that's a longer story.""  THAT'S THE EXPLANATION WE GET?  For a game that barely played out at over 7 hours, you don't have time to explain that serious piece of tripe?!?

On a completely unrelated note, it's weird that the cutscenes...which should be fully rendered movies, mind you...actually exhibit a great deal of framerate stutter and tearing than the actual gameplay itself.  HUH?

The novelty of playing in the Aliens universe with the weaponry that fascinated me when I was 13 expels itself during the course of this slog-fest and I honestly wish that I could sue Gearbox for fooling us with the demo video that was presented last summer.  What was shown in that demo versus the final product are NIGHT AND DAY.

Pass this journey.  If you're a die-hard, wait until it hits the $19.99 bin of disappointment.

1.0,False,"11 16, 2008",AIR57G6ARRC5P,B000UU5T7E,waterbowl,"What made the original Fallout so good?

It was the non-linear gameplay, the tactical turn-based combat, the game setting, and of course, Macgyver.

I loved the original Fallout. I bought that game the day it came out and I played the Hell out of it. Does Fallout 3 live up to the Fallout name? Does an original fan think it's a worthy addition? Read on to find out.

There was only one thing the first Fallout set out to do. Fallout wanted to be the role playing game that let you do what you want, let you go where you want, let you kill who you want. Role playing games before this never had this sense about them, all their stories were linear and were already set for you. There wouldn't be all these role playing games today that gave you choices if it wasn't for Fallout. It was the first game to put it into the mainstream.

Fallout 3 does a good job of letting you do what you want. You are allowed to be good or evil, killing the dog or saving the dog(remember that, original Fallout fans?). However, the dialogues in the game are unintelligent and leave you wondering if they tried hard to copy the first game's conversations, or if they just grabbed a student from the local college to do them. Either way, they did a bad job with dialogues. When you role play in a game and you get dialogue options, effort should be done so the options vary in being evil or good, so you don't sound like the opposite of what you are, and most importantly, so you don't sound like an idiot. Speaking of which, the dialogues in the original Fallout actually had idiot dialogue options, in Fallout 3, every option is an idiot option, even if your intelligence is set at 10. Dialogue is dumbed down.

The tactical combat from the first Fallout was almost perfect. What Fallout 3 does, is not improve on the tactical side of combat, it ruins combat instead. They changed turn-based combat into a real-time click-affair. All you do in combat is click the left mouse button as fast as you can to shoot your weapons at the enemies. In combat, you also get to use VATS, which lets you pause in real-time to choose specific body parts to target. But it's totally pointless. There is no reason to use VATS, as it offers nothing, nothing tactical, nothing. I have played 30 hours into the game so far(on hard setting), and I have yet to use VATS once. If you want to cheat, use VATS, because all VATS does is let you cheat. Fallout fans want to be challenged with tactical combat, not play a casual combat clickfest. Combat is dumbed down.

They did manage to get the atmosphere down to a point. It's really not hard to make something look apocalyptical, but to make it look right is harder to achieve. One thing in the game that you'll notice, is that they use lots of gore. Fallout was never about gore, but seems the makers of Fallout 3 didn't get that. You find loads of chopped up bodies all over the place, as if the level designers thought it looked cool to have rooms filled with 20 chopped up bodies all around. Gore is upped up, which means it's been dumbed down, because too much gore means you aren't trying hard enough with actual content. You go for the ""shock factor"", not the ""content factor"". The game is more like Postal 3 than it is like Fallout 3. They did get the 50's jibe down really well, and I love that part of the game. Kudos to them for keeping that part.

The story in the game as a whole isn't bad at all, I just wish it was written better. I loved discovering other real vaults in Fallout, and you get to do that in Fallout 3 as well. The main campaign is pretty short, but so was Fallout's. In Fallout you could beat the game within 20 minutes, can't do it that fast in Fallout 3, but it's still short in it's own right. There's plenty of side quests to do, just like in the original Fallout. The side quest's can be long to complete, having you run around talking to several people and going to several places before you are able to complete it, but the side quests haven't been that challenging(maybe because combat is too easy? Or is it because they have arrows that point you to where everything is?).

IN CONCLUSION:

Fallout 3 is like an open sandbox RPG. It lacks the depth of the originals and it appeals to the casual audience of today. It is not a traditional CRPG like Fallout, it is a console RPG ported to the PC. It lacks what a good port should, with bad controls and a bad interface.

The game needs patching. The game crashes constantly on me. I get a lot of slowdowns after a few moment of play, when the game starts it's perfectly smooth. The game has many software problems the developers need to fix.

Overall, the game is fun, and as an original Fallout fan, I see it as a good spin off set in the Fallout universe. I do recommend it to fans of the original, as long as they know they aren't going to experience what Fallout gave them. There's some nostalgia to be had here, with familiar characters you meet and things you hear, but it's not the CRPG you love.

One last note. They also changed the name of the guns in the game. If you needed any proof of the dumbing down of the game, even without all the other stuff, just look at the names. Dumbing down weapon's names to appeal to today's lazy casual audience? I just have to say, ""give me a break"".

Some of the scenes were lame, why was one of the teammates farting and getting diarrhea? You are expected to sneak around and be stealthy in the middle of a warzone? I tried shooting my way through, but that didn't work all the time. The cut-scenes were too long. I had no idea what they were talking about, and when I did, it was not interesting. The weapons and gears didn't have any specific purpose, except just sleep, silence, or hard-killing. The controls were very hard to use. I kept mixing up the movements. It was difficult to switch and use the weapons and gears. FPS view was not as easy to use as real FPS shooters. The camera was the worst. It just spins around everywhere since it is so close to Snake, not much overhead like the old MGS. The graphic was average, nothing too spectacular, but I guess that's because MGS4 is an old game. It doesn't look as good as Killzone, Crysis, Socom, or Red Dead. I guess standard for games are much higher today.

I was very excited when it first arrived on the market and thought it would be fun having a new town and farm to play on a portable handheld. But unfortunately, this game turned out to be absolutely terrible and a huge miss that just gave more evidence that Harvest Moon has fallen way downhill since it's heyday on the Nintendo 64 and Playstation.

First of all, the farming is basically torture. Not only do you have to build your own barns but they can fall down and all of your animals can die. You have to be kidding me. There is absolutely no way playing with this system could be fun. It is just stressful and too much work for a game that used to be so relaxing to play on a calm day. I did enjoy the addition of having a cat and dog and I thought the layout and look to the farm was nice. Really, it all does look nice graphically wise. Forever Not Valley looks rather cute and clear on the Nintendo DS and I liked all of the graphic sprites. But this does not take away that the town has no substance whatsoever. The characters are absolutely boring compared to previous titles and I have no urge to be friends with any of these people besides that they look cute. They are one dimensional and if they appear to have conflicts in the beginning of the game, they never come to surface or change. Yawn.

As proof that characterization has gone down since the original games, I will compare this game to Harvest Moon 64 and Friends of Mineral Town. Lumina is my favorite girl in this game and Karen is my favorite in Friends of Mineral Town and 64.

Nintendo 64 - Karen
The most memorable heart event was saving the vineyard after your effort! Karen comes over to your house to invite you over to see fairies kissing the fruit and begins to dance because she is just so overwhelmingly happy. It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in a video game. Not to mention, Karen was full of depth. Her father was an abusive alcoholic, the family business was poor until you help, she longed to live in the city, etc.

Friends of Mineral Town - Karen
The most memorable heart event was when Karen discovers that her father had bottles of wine stored for her as a baby. You must go to the neighbor's vineyard to help her carry them back home. When you get back she gives you a bottle as a gift. While is not nearly as special as the previous, I found it to be rather cute and unique! In this game Karen is not nearly as feisty but enjoys wine, is good talking with others, and is a romantic.

Forget Me Not Valley - Lumina
All of her heart events consist of a DVD player. Yes. A DVD player. How romantic. She is nice and sometimes she likes to plays the piano.

A Harvest Moon game with no characterization just takes about half the fun out of the game. This combined with the boring and long tedious farming system makes this game a waste! Please do not waste your time on this game.",I will never purchase another Harvest Moon game.,1375920000,,,

This time, it would not eject my NCAA Football game so I had to force open the disc tray just to get my game out.  Once again, Sony would do nothing.  The warranty was only for 90 days, thus the 6 month time frame did not allow warranty coverage.  This was a very disappointing product, as I had never had problems with Sony products before.  I enjoyed many of the games I played on the PS2, I just believe that it should last longer than 6-8 months.  I bought an Xbox and never had any problems with it.  Ever.

It made zero sense to me...insanely stupid, bizarre & nonsensical).  I also got stuck in a weapons trial & had to quit the game and reload it!  Again, it's obvious this thing was rushed to market.

--The graphics are glitchy.  Polygons pop in & out constantly.  That didn't even happen on the PS2 R&C games.

--The camera in this game sucks.  It doesn't recenter itself after you move it, so you end up constantly having to fight with it.  Cheap deaths will result.  There's also so much 'foliage' and other little details in this game that end up getting in the way of the camera & obstructing your view.

--Too many little nooks & crannies (especially in the first few stages) where Ratchet gets stuck.

--The initial 'gravity' stages are disorienting much of the time.  In fact I found myself disoriented through much of this game.

--No customizable controls (I'm accustomed to using the O button for firing like in previous R&C games, but that's not an option here so I was hitting the wrong button CONSTANTLY throughout the game).

--Quick-selecting weapons does NOT work properly & you often end up having to fight with the analog stick & quick-select menu to get it to highlight the correct weapon.

--Some of the sound effects are downright obnoxious (like the pause sound).

--It's simply not fun.  I'm glad I only paid twenty bones for it (Black Friday sale) and was able to unload it on someone else for the same price I bought it for.  This one's a dog.  Glad it's over.",Terrible,1388188800,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

After the initial part of the review, I will discuss the main reason why I gave this game 1 star which is the Broken Mechanics.  This is also what the pictures and video themselves relate to.  Other big issues with the game are its Online Component and Design.

Graphics:
Okay, okay I'm not a graphics type gamer where its end all be all, but let's get real; the game looks around the same quality as Tekken 5 which was released back on the PS2.  To be honest, King of Fighters 14 does looks better but the fact that this is actually comparable is not...a good sign.  Not a huge deal for me (gameplay is most important for me), but the fact that the PS4's ability is SOOOO underutilized is quite distressing and the fact that it is not at all aesthetically pleasing to look at some of the characters who look bland and washed out.  Some may like the graphics, but this is an eye of the beholder thing I guess.

Music:
Not a fan.  It's some very weird brain scattering j-rock that hurts my ears, especially the main menu theme.  Seriously just listen to it for 4 minutes.  It's an incredible step back from the previous sound tracks.  Especially the Esaka theme which sounded godly awesome in KOF 12 yet sounds way to cheery with way too many light overtones KOF 14.  I advise anyone to listen to the difference of the two.  Anyhow some are nice like the Art of Fighting Theme or Athena's seem to fit and sound nice.  Again, music like anything is up to the eye of the beholder, but in my opinion the music in KOF 14 is nothing special.

Content:
Okay the game is fully fledged and on release woot!  It's got a story mode, trials, time attack, Survival, lots of customization, replay vids, and more!  It's nice to see a game come fully packaged at launch for once!  Unfortunately this is pretty much where the good stuff ends.

Online:
Alright so this is, bad.  The main reason to play any fighting game in my opinion is to test your metal against players around the world.  Unfortunately the netcode in this game is beyond bad.  One out of five or so matches will feel like your players are moving in molasses.  If an opponent rage quits the game can freeze which can hamper your game records such as matches completed.  Other smaller issues would be the game boots you back to the main menu half of the time when searching for opponents.  Not a big deal but after hitting the search button for the 20th time in a row it gets old fast.

Design:
Why couldn't they just have the game keep searching and let me decide when I want to back out?  To top it off one thing a lot of new fighting games (even last gen) now have the option for the player to receive online matches ranked or non ranked while doing other things like practicing on a dummy, playing story mode, etc.  This is bad design and if KOF 14 wants to compete with modern fighters it really should ""modernize itself"" a bit.  To top it off SNK thought it would be a great idea to include a button mash button (SQUARE) or known as the ""Rush Down"" technique that if hit over and over the player can take his/her opponents health down by 1/6 or even 1/5 depending if meter is present.  This is just an absurd addition and design choice so that players that are new can just spam one move over and over.  If you want a fighting game to relate to the general populace more have a better tutorial.  When going online people literally just run at you spamming this crap, and it wouldn't be so bad if the game's own mechanics weren't broken or laggy online.  Worse yet is that the input lag can be up to 6f.  Just unacceptable.  The AI is no prize winner either.  Okay at level 3 the AI is simply bad and just stands there, not kidding.  At level 5 (max) the AI is barely passable and feels like easy mode.  Just wait for it to do an unsafe move then unload rush mode on it.  Even at this stage the AI will occasionally...just stand there.

Broken Mechanics:
Okay, so this is the main reason why the game lost so many stars in my review: the game mechanics are broken.  I know what you're thinking but it is real.  At first when playing online I got the feeling I couldn't block or hit opponents accordingly, and I thought that maybe this game is different.  After all, sometimes attacks that appear to hit high actually hit low and vice versa or even mid range.  I decided to go over one of my previous matches and lo and behold I found out the game doesn't follow its own rules.  what I found was quite disturbing.  In the game itself it says command moves such as Kyo's overhead kick known in the game as ""Ge-shiki Gofu Yo"" should hit mid range and should be ""UNBLOCKABLE WHEN GUARDING LOW"".  Please see the first two pics.  However in a match this did not happen at all and in fact I lost a ranked match due to this and probably a lot more since finally catching on.  After double checking in versus locally I found that indeed Kyo's overhead should break through a low guard as described by the game's tutorial.  If you look at the third picture captured in game with the key data present you can clearly see that my opponent on the left (Terry) was guarding low (notice the blue light indicating a block) and nothing else going on but this should not have happened as the game clearly states itself that Kyo's overhead kick should break through the low guard if nothing else is going on.  In the fourth picture after several key presses I show that my opponent does a correctly timed GC BLOW BACK move on me which is legit and nothing wrong here and is just here to help show what is happening in this small time frame. In the fifth picture I show what is SUPPOSED to happen (notice the white/red flash indicating damage).  I've also included a video of the entire incident that goes slow mo at the point of the problem. This is not just happening with Kyo either as lots of other character's command moves are not hitting appropriately.  So at this point, either the game decides randomly when to apply it's own rules as a result of lag from netcode, lazy developers forgetting to code probably, or it is most likely a combination of all of the above.

Conclusion:
Because the game is unplayable due to the atrocious netcode causing molasses style gameplay, freezing, and other problems in account with the broken mechanics I can't honestly give this game a good review.  Bad Graphics, a lackluster story, and ear splitting music don't help the score either.  With the AI being really bad as discussed along with the broken mechanics and often unplayable netcode all you can really do in this game is trials, but if you can overlook all of that which...is a lot to overlook I guess you'll have a good time.  The sad thing is that I really like this game, when it works.  I've heard there is a netcode patch that is coming but until it comes I would recommend people to think carefully before buying this.

**********************Update 8/29/2016**************************

Great games have stunning compelling graphics created by an army of graphics artists. Instead, Hello Games is still talking about its algorithms.

The game is devoid of warmth or humanity. Your character has no body, personality or customizable attributes. It is a space suit; in the end just like every other players spacesuit. There are a couple of cartoon alien character models whose voices are a few screeches. You don't learn their languages; their statements finally appear in English after youve clicked 400+ buttons scattered about the landscape.

The space ships look like they're from a toddlers coloring book. The space ship control panels still look like sketches on a napkin. The pacing of action is incredibly sparse and jerky. You teleport by listening to a vacuum cleaner sound for 20 seconds while a yellow blob pulses on screen.

Nothing has a purpose. The game is endless monotony. The Foundation update added more fetch quests to keep you busy; very busy because finding what you need to fetch is random and requires lots of slow monotonous travel. The PathFinder update just adds more of the same. The updates jut give the game more opportunities to tell you to do more things to try to keep you busy so you don't notice they have nothing to do with moving towards completion of the game. They remove some tedium of surface travel, at the expense of requiring a lot more of it.

1.0,False,"06 6, 2010",A39S6ONDFHQ59C,B00269QLJ2,A. Deguglielmo,"After playing such a fun game like Call of Duty 4 on the PC you'd figure the sequel would be something worthwhile. If that was your thought process, then you were dead wrong.

  First off, let me start with the campaign. You play as several characters. During the single-player campaign, the player controls five different characters from a first-person perspective. For the majority of the game, the player assumes the role of Sergeant Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson, a member of an elite, multi-national commando unit known as Task Force 141. However, the player begins the game through the eyes of Private First Class Joseph Allen, a Ranger stationed in Afghanistan, who later goes undercover in Russia for the CIA under the alias of ""Alexei Borodin."" Private James Ramirez, a member of 1st Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment stationed in the United States, serves as the player character during the defense of the United States eastern coast against a Russian invasion. John ""Soap"" MacTavish returns as a non-playable character for most of the game, but once again becomes the player character in the final three missions. In the five years since Call of Duty 4 took place, he has been promoted to the rank of captain in the Special Air Service. He now commands most of Task Force 141 and its field operations, acting as the superior officer of Sanderson. The player also briefly assumes the role of an unnamed International Space Station astronaut during an EVA in the minute or so prior to the station's destruction.

  The campaign is fun and takes you to many parts of the world, and there is a special game mode called ""Spec Ops"" in which you have a certain objective you must complete. These both have little replay value and therefore I'm basing my opinion of the game on the multiplayer aspect.

  Where do I even start with the multiplayer? First off, you have to link your multiplayer account to something called Steam, which is a gaming website/program. This means if you plan to re-sell the game, think again because this makes it close to impossible. Next, there's no dedicated servers. That's right. That means that whichever player hosts the game will usually have the advantage because he has the best connection. It is very difficult to connect to multiplayer online and when you do, you'll be lucky to get an entire match in. Hackers released a patch for the game which allowed dedicated servers but Infinity Ward quickly dealt with them. Another major flaw is no mods. Call of Duty 4 for PC allowed you to use mods which made the game more fun and addictive but for whatever reason Infinity Ward took them out.

  Ok so now that I've talked about the connection issues, let's get to the actual gameplay. It is very similar to the previous Call of Duty, except with improved graphics and some new guns. The new perks and weapon attachments can be really cheap and give players a far superiority over you, same thing with the weapons. This can make the game extremely frustrating. Also, the new selectable killstreaks can be annoying sometimes. Other than that, leveling up and prestiging can become old, repetitive, and boring.

  So my final words of advice to you: stay away from this game. Save yourself some money, time, and frustration.","Really, Infinity Ward?",1275782400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have the last physical release of Killer Instinct, so this purchase was mainly to get all the additional content that I can't download due to not having home internet.

When I popped the disc in the Xbox everything started to install from the disc including all the DLC characters that I purchased this release specifically for. Well to my huge disappointment when I opened the game after the full install the game would not let me play any dlc characters. I keep getting an error message to ""connect to Xbox live"".

Let's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.

There are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.

This newly redesigned PSP 2000 case WILL fit your PSP game console even if you have the 2200mAh battery with extended back-plate.  There is designated cutout in the rubber that allows the PSP 2000 to rest perfectly in place with or without the extended battery cover.

Now the explanation for the one star rating:

The case itself looks a lot sleeker in the package and in pictures than envolped around the PSP system itself.  It has a cheap plasticy feel to it complete with a second rate, floating hinge that always seems as if its on the verge of breaking loose.

Also, unlike other PSP cases I've owned, the PSP logo isn't etched or inscribed onto the case lid, even though it looks that way in pictures.  The PSP trademark on top is just a thin piece of printed cardboard placed underneath the clear shell.

This case also comes complete with small rubber grips that, when opened properly, can be used to stand the case upright so you can view video files without holding the PSP in your hands.  Only problem is the rubber grips never seem to hold onto whatever surface its standing on.  It will slowly start to slide downward unitl it is laying flat on the table, the counter, the desk...etc..

This case looks, feels and performs more like a $5.00 cheapo instead of a $20.00 quality product.  For this price I would find something better (and you can...very easily) instead of settling for this lesser product.",CHEAPLY REDESIGNED FOR THE PSP 2000,1211760000,14,,

I don't know what the game designers were thinking with this. The ""plot"" is virtually non-existant. The game is basically a series of battles. There are no puzzles, nothing in particular to unlock except new battles, and very little sense of progress. There's virtually nil NPC interaction and nothing to figure out. If I wanted a game that was nothing but combat, I wouldn't be playing FF, i'd break out my old copy of the PC dos-based Dungeon Hack (which is exactly what it sounds like).

The laws are arbitrary. Restrictions on what kind of combat you're allowed to engage in SHOULD make a game interesting (they at least keep you from overspecializing in, say, warriors or wizards). But when the game arbitrarily and randomly decides ""you can't use weapons in this battle"" or ""you can't use magic in this battle"" with no real rationale, you just start to get annoyed with it. A MUCH better way of preventing over specialization is to throw the player up against a wider variety of monsters so that they MUST have multiple classes to be able to play to all the enemy's strengths and weaknesses.

I also really dislike the idea of gaining skills by equiping certain items (instead of, oh, you know, USING the skills in question?). The result is that you end up equipping really weak and generally useless items for longer than you conceivably would in any other game, or you end up lacking very basic skills. Both are artificially limiting.

Overall, I think the game just lacks a lot of what makes the Final Fantasy franchise such a popular one, and that's a shame, especially consider how good the original Tactics is supposed to be. This is the first time I've ever NOT finished an FF game that I bought. Not because it was difficult, but because it was mind-numbing.",A big disappointment,1227484800,2,,

Battlefield 4 is a huge disappointment. Not only are the multiplayer maps smaller, the gameplay is more like COD; run around as fast as you can and shoot any enemies you run into. Even worse, this game is riddled with numerous technical problems that make the game virtually unplayable at times.
There are too many problems to list here and likely even more that I haven't encountered yet but here's a few:
The game freezes constantly, especially in Multiplayer mode; all progress and XP is lost and the Xbox console has to be rebooted. This is really frustrating and takes a lot of fun out of the multiplayer game. The loadout menus are hard to navigate and apparently you can only change weapons while you are in a game. Using the server browser can often be a ""road to nowhere""; plenty of empty servers but you can't get into any of them. Getting into an online game is where the game seems to freeze the most. If you have a bunch of friends playing, you can't join as a squad. The launch weekend double XP wasn't working either; Dice's way of thanking customers who pre-ordered or bought the game on the release date.
There are significant issues with the gameplay as well. Players are hard to see at times, often you don't see who killed you until after you're dead. There are major issues with the netcode(the computer code used for online gameplay); you can be killed before an enemy even fires a shot, you empty a clip into him and are killed before he even fires his weapon. As far as weapons go, you can empty an assault rifle clip into an enemy a couple hundred yards away with no effect and he winds up shooting you with a couple shots from a pistol. This makes for a lot of snipers; since you can kill an enemy at the same distance with a sniper rifle or pistol, why not? Camperland; if you stop running, you usually are killed by one of the many snipers. Hard to tell how many hits it takes to kill somebody; I snuck up on a sniper, emptied a full clip from a SCAR-L assault rifle into his head from six inches away, he got up and killed me with a pistol.
OK, it's a new game, there's bound to be some glitches, right? Battlefield 4 does not have glitches, it has major problems; a game that crashes your system and does not work should have never been released. Dice will fix it with a client side patch, right? Don't hold your breath. With Xbox One coming out in a few weeks, most likely the Battlefield 4 for that console has big problems as well and Dice has every available employee working on that so the Xbox One version doesn't crash and burn like this Xbox 360 version did, Xbox 360 gamers are probably going to be in for a long wait until the problems with this game are fixed.
When you pre-order a game on Amazon, it can take a week to get it with standard shipping, never mind the free shipping. You might miss the bonus XP weekend they usually throw on a game's release. This game's double XP weekend was a big fail so I guess it didn't matter in this case. It was also supposed to come with an ""exclusive Amazon pre-order battlepack"" which I have not received. Thankfully, I was able to cancel the COD Ghosts Hardened Edition I pre-ordered from Amazon, I'll never pre-order another video game from them again, just not worth it.
Battlefield 4 is pretty much a loser all the way around. These game developers don't seem to have much respect for their customers, it's getting harder to keep shelling out $60 a game. I'm sure glad I did not pre-order the Xbox One.",Don't Waste Your Money On Battlefreeze 4,1383609600,,,

We had a contest going to see who could get the most stickers by the end of the year, and he won by 2.

My brother's never actually broke physically, but always had problems with the dongle not connecting all the way which caused cut-outs in the sound or would never stay connected, or the speakers themselves would stop working if he did a sound test. My breaks were always physical. On the bright side, we have 8 sets of splitters which are actually more useful. We also never abused the headsets in any way shape or form since they cost nearly $100 and we like taking care of our things.

It's a little sad because these headsets sounded great and would have been awesome if they could last longer than a month at a time. The amount of speakers caused them to be on the heavy side which made them hard to wear for long periods of time, but that doesn't matter because they'll slide off when the plastic gives up. After this experience I've found out it's better to go with stereo headsets and use simulated 5.1 or 7.1 sound; they're lighter and have less chances of going wrong, and it sounds just as good (this obviously depends on your intended audio use). Also, depending on the brand, they won't break before you can even consider them used. I'm never buying Turtle Beach again after this experience.",Just Bad,1359504000,,,

If Barnum knew anything about Sony's vertical and horizontal stands for the PS2, he would have added, ""And that sucker shells out 10-15 bucks for useless plastic.
I'm sure Sony had some reasoning (other than money) to create and market this thing.  The carpeting thing as many people mentioned is one, but I don't see why anyone would do that in the first place.  I think it even says in the PS2 instructions not to place it on carpet.  And I know that it's not for stability (though the title of my review may be poking fun at it), but this thing is all around useless.
Look at the features: Air circulation?  Raises the gaming unit?  STABILIZES?!?!  Sleek design and looks cool.  Whatever.  Wanna know how to get around this?  Circulation - don't put your PS2 on carpet, under water, buried in dirt, or anywhere near your little brother's Pokemon toys.  Raises the gaming unit - try putting it up on blocks as one reviewer suggested, or if you like get a car jack and just raise the thing and lower it to your preference.  Stabilizes - I could go into a fifteen paragraph tangent about that one but I wont.  You all know what I would say.  Sleek design and looks cool - if you're worried about your PS2's looks, you probably have more issues than a horizontal stand can fix.  And if you're that concerned, the PS2 will always look ""cooler"" than that purple toaster oven-shaped mini-disk playing Game Cube.  No offense to Nintendo.
I reviewed the vertical stand too, and I basically said the same thing.  I don't own either, and I have no plans to buy them.  I think it's just a way for Sony to rip people off.  No other game system needs something like this, and I'm sure the next generation Playstation won't need it either.

When the game starts, there's a nice cinematic which sets up the story - quite interesting really. When the actual game starts the first thing you'll notice is that the camera is stuck in third person. Fine, it's a third person shooter. The problem is the character fills up a chunk of the screen. The next thing you might notice is that the character is difficult to turn. Well, if you're like me, you just turned down the sensitivity. Turning it back up to the default makes the game playable, and jacking it all the way up makes it interesting, but the character never moved at a good rate for me. Perhaps I'm just new to the TPS genre and that's how it's supposed to be.
Anyway, as you play through the first level you will come into many rooms with large, noisy objects. At random intervals these objects will make random, unrelated sounds, such as whispering in the tram tunnels and clashing tools in deserted rooms. IMO, the sounds should at least fit the setting.

Sure, it's declined over the years, mostly due (IMO) to bad developer decions to focus on being ""cool"" instead of having actual heart and depth of characters - but I still consider this among my top 5 favorite game series.

Now, on to this train wreck of a game. It's bad. Really bad. So bad that it's not even worth considering to purchase. There's absolutely nothing to do in the game except to kill identical looking mobs over and over and over for hours on end. Every couple days you can do 8 miniquests that will help break up the monotony of the grind - but then it's right back to it. Every 10 or so levels you get a few Main Storyline quests which are actually nicely done... but very short lived. Then it's back to the grind.

Add on to that a terrible ui that is purely a console port, servers that aren't language seperated (you think gold spammers are annoying? wait till you see them writing in a language you don't even understand), inconsistant framerate drops even on cutting edge PCs, a lack of communication between devs and the community, the most boring set of classes (and recycled races) I have yet to encounter and a limit on the amount of experience you can gain over time (put into place, according to rumors, to accomodate the Chinese government) - and you have one of the worst mmorpgs ever to be conceived.

1.0,False,"04 10, 2005",A3L6S86HGO9OUW,B000066TS5,Madisen,"This game has a great idea behind it. Putting characters from two beloved franchises (Final Fantasy and Disney) into a brand-new storyline with a few new, original characters is a stroke of genius, and it works well. The environments are colorful and perfectly capture the fantasy vibe; the original PSone models of old FF characters are brought to the next-gen world with great graphics and superb voice-acting. The story itself is also interesting. So I happily leapt into this game, really excited about the whole thing.

Then, something terrible happened: gameplay. Sora (the main character) moves so clunkily and imprecisely that both combat and exploration are a chore. If battles were turn-based in classic Square fashion, this would be easier to deal with, but they're not. They're done in real-time, meaning that you are never given a rest from the painful controls. No matter how fast I tapped the buttons or moved the control stick, Sora's attacks were always several steps behind my commands. And when I was platforming in the ""exploration"" segments, his pitiful jumps and tendency to keep moving once I released the analog stick was continually frustrating.

All this wouldn't be so bad if the game was forgiving enough to accomodate the interface, but that isn't the case. Indeed, the difficulty is actually harder than many games I've played with better control schemes. Enemies are whip-quick and surround you in a flash; platforms are tiny and widely spaced; and replenishing items are always in short supply.

Another complaint I have is that the puzzles don't make sense. Unlike better RPGs (Paper Mario 2, for example), where you can analyze the area and figure out what you're supposed to do, Kingdom Hearts gives you no clues. I would have been stumped within minutes if I didn't have the strategy guide to back me up. Like everything else in the game, the puzzles must be done perfectly, with no mistakes, or you have to start over. Seeing as you don't know if something is a mistake or not until you do it, this gets very tedious and frustrating.

Overall, playing this game felt like trying to dismantle a ticking time bomb with no tools, where touching one wire could mean death: stressful, confusing, and definitely not fun. And after a while, it doesn't even matter that the bomb is decorated with beloved characters and bright colors.","Excellent concept, shoddy gameplay.",1113091200,28,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The voice acting didn't have the best voices, and the characters were either so subtly played or over the top that they didn't have the same feel. Locke was an insufferably annoying philosopher, spouting of fortune cookie quotes about you and the island, and providing little real help. Kate and Jack were tolerable, but so ephemeral that the might as well have not been present. No other Lostie was present, and the camp was so small as to hold maybe 20 people, not the 50 that are really cast.

The gameplay consisted of glaringly obvious puzzles and tracking through the jungle for 30 minute stretchs: 5 minutes of walking and 25 minutes of waiting for the black smoke monster to leave. This alternated with 2 minute mazes where your torch or lantern was your essential life bar.

The flashbacks did much to make up for it, and had a good feel. But nothing could detract from the shear awfulness.

The story was so abrupt, so short, that you'd think the cast was stuck on the island for all of 5 or 6 days, with the 2nd day being when the hatch is blown. No regard is made for canon except in the most vestigal sense. Some neat secrets are revealed, but nothing that couldn't be figured out from the show.

As an example, Limbo debited 3+ years ago on Xbox 360, and it just came out on Xbox One. I enjoyed Fruit Ninja over 2 years ago, and it's still not available for Xbox One!! Such a let-down.

Please explain why they made a new console that won't play Xbox 360 games? That's really stupid, and I have only myself to blame because I trusted Microsoft to port existing games quickly, since they've decided to break compatibility on purpose.

I would also like to point out that Xbox One games/apps are sluggish despite the up-to-date hardware. For example, Xbox Fitness is absolutely painful to use, as it loads a full minute (which feels like an eternity) and all animations and transitions are horribly rough.

Another source of frustration is the dashboard UI. Browsing for games (which I do frequently, hoping to find something interesting) is very confusing?! It's either one flat list of all games, or poorly defined categories with very limited number of titles. And I can't still figure out how to rate and review games/apps...

The drop rates are better because of a lack of Auction House.

What bugs me most is how pointless actually playing on the console is, anyone with some know-how could probably just pull their hard-drive from their Xbox/ps3 and manipulate their Save-File, which essentially turns the console version into an OPEN B.Net (hacks/mods/modified characters and items etc.. etc...) its only a matter of time.

Again No real PvP System STILL brawling is pointless and its a one-shot fest, i either one shot you, or you one shot me 50/50 so there is no real pvp system which makes all that loot gathering pointless.

Not many of the levels were amazing, either. Just long hallways, small rooms, and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up. I like 3D games that let you be outside, looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles. Half-Life just didn't cut it in this  arena.
Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  gore/violence that is present throughout the game. When your science  project goes wrong, you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor! Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what? When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts (who are the best  enemies), it gets even more grotesque. If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy, expect to see a wall covered with blood. Sure, you can  turn it off, but it does very little good. The blood is still very  disturbing. This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable.  I am not a parent saying this, either, I'm a teenager.

1.0,False,"09 20, 2006",A2AD63ZI1TEUY2,B000FUG5WC,Timothy E. Mattson,"The idiots at ubisoft got together one day and decided to make the worst role playing game in the history of role playing games.

What they ended up doing to accomplish this was take every negative factor from all past role playing games, and jam them all into one horrifically bad excuse for a video game.

The dialogue in this game is completely irrelevant.  There is no reason to pay attention to any of it, anything you need to know you'll figure out on your own.  There is hours of spoken dialogue in this game, none of it bears any purpose.  Characters speak, but they say absolutely nothing.  Conversations that go like ""How are you?""  ""I am ok.""  ""You look cold""  ""I am cold""  ""Thank you"".  After that waste of programming code, you're allowed to continue on.  The spoken dialogue is also done by what have to be the most unproffesional voice actors I've ever heard.  They either over emphasize the idiotic personality of the character, or don't give the character any personality at all.  You will speed click through all the dialogue in the game, that is if you end up wasting your money on this game.

The game is just one long straight line with random encounters along the way.  I spoiled the entire game for you right there.  You run forward, fight some monsters, and win the game.  That's not worth sixty dollars in my opinion.  Ubisoft deliberately released a game after putting absolutely no effort into making it interesting.  You get one town of irrelevant and annoying dialogue, where the high point is running around collecting tickets.  Final Fantasy X was just a game where you run forward throughout the whole thing, but at least they realized that they had to make their characters slightly interesting.

The battle system is slow, and makes the turn based system of battle look even more ridiculous than ever.  It's like the battle system from koudelka, you're on your own grid and use ranged attacks against your enemy who's on their own grid.  This is the most irratating system for turn based battle in my opinion.  Ubisoft will probably explain that they thought long and hard about it and decided to make a turn based battle system that let's you use strategy to defeat your enemies, they just forgot to plan the actual enemies in the game around this concept.  What I mean by that is you fight enemies who can attack every square on your grid, and you gain abilities where you can attack every square on their grid.  Chess it is not, more like turn based Rochambeau.

The menus in the game are very time consuming, and were obviously just thrown together and abandoned.  You make a weapon in one menu, quit that menu, open a different menu, equip the weapon.  You buy a skill in one menu, quit that menu, open a different menu, learn the skill, back out of that part of the menu, equip the skill.  Ubisoft apparently thinks that when you make a decision to own something, it's for the sheer joy of knowing that it's not being used as a part of your repitoire.

One are where they obviously invested (wasted) alot of effort was in making neat little companions, which they call ""golems"".  There's alot of them in this game, so you can have fun making them and looking at them.  You'll only use one at a time, so the other sixty will have to wait in limbo.  Each one is designed to be unique and speak one of two styles of japanese, slow and menacing or high and hyper.  They even wrote biographies for each golem, they explain their uniquely irrelevant details.

Starting off with it having a proprietary usb connection meaning that it is not very flexible if you lose your cord. The system has displayed some improvement on size but now has a smaller battery and a smaller amount of juice to ""balance"" it out. Another major flaw that has to do with the battery is you can no longer switch it out with an extra battery. Meaning that if your on a long road trip and you drain the battery your little system now is useless in till the next overnight stop. The biggest flaw design wise is where they placed the analog nub it is now even harder to use do to it's placement. Sony could have at least swapped the D-pad and the Nub around for more comfort. A good thing about the PSPgo is that when you buy it you get 4 free games. But the counter side to it is the PSP's wireless hardware it well not good enough to download the sheer size of the games. Another problem is if your doing downloading over wireless connection and you go out of range you have to start the download all over again which can be very aggravating if you forget about the download. If i were to designing this thing would I have at least upped the wireless speed and being able to continue a partially completed downloads. Another thing that i would have added is the ability to use homebrew apps which older PSP's already can do if you can hack them which most PSP's (100x-200x)are able. The x is the digit of which region the psp is from and it is variably of each region US or NTSC PSP's are 2001 for example. The only ones that are not completely hackable of the older PSP's is the 300x's (the brite in other words) and some 200x's (the slim in other words). The fact that it is a all digital system meaning that you have to download each game through a wireless router or the MediaGo software (which is very slow and clunky just like the software before it), is a good idea on paper but the system just doesn't deliver. The missing UMD drive is something that I do miss a little bit because if you do own any UMDs they can't be played on the Go. And man, I have so many UMD games from US versions to Japanese versions. But a plus side is that it doesn't have a massive amount of drain on the battery anymore. But sony could have fit the UMD easily on the go with no problem and keeping the form factor pretty well. the UMD drive only takes up about eighth of a inch in thickness and about 2 and 1/2 inches in length and the goes fold down bottom (the section were the buttons are) could have easly made the system rounded and slapped it on the back there. The raised back would have also added a little more grip on the system. out of every console i have bought from Sony (which means the ps1-ps3 and PSP 100x- to Go) this is the only system that disappointed me and i didn't even get on to the insane $*** dollars price tag. Which $*** of the price is for the air inside the system.
Cause I mean, c'mon.  Why would you pay that much for a tiny system like this?  You could get a Wii for that price, or a ps3 just with a couple of more dollars or so.  But, if you're already a gamer with a regular psp, please keep it.

So when I saw the sequel on the store shelf I thought to myself that it would probably have all those flaws improved upon while still keeping it's great strategy elements.  So I bought the game hoping to be able to live out my favorite scenes from the Godfather.  At first the game was amusing, but after those quick 10 minutes, the game was quickly repackaged and returned!
First off, the strategy elements of the game are completely gone!  Everyone used to complain about the micro-management in the first, so I guess the solution was to completely erase all management. You're basically told what business to buy and it just generates money.
The graphics are a bit cartoonish, but fitting.  Although the graphics aren't realistic or polygonal they match the theme of the game and give it the appropriate feel.  Unfortunately, that's all this game has!  Good looks, good packaging, no substance!
The gameplay is terrible!  You'll pull your hair out as you order your goons to drive two blocks away and watch him circle around the whole neighborhood before finally going to his destination... and hopefully he's not there to do a drive-by!  The drive-by shootings in this game are just ridiculous.  You'll quickly despise watching your thugs drive past, shoot, make a U-turn, drive back, shoot more, make another U-turn, shoot (you get the point).  That doesn't seem like a very effective drive-by to me.  Also, the people standing on the side walk never EVER take cover, they just stand there shooting at the car until they are FINALLY gunned down.  What kind of dumb gangsters are these anyway?  The AI definately needs improving!  Also, don't get your car ruined.  If you do, then you have the option of stealing your enemies car, but only HIS car.  What sense does this make?  My thugs have no problem with gunning down police officers but they refuse to steal an innocent person's car.  I had to run 4 blocks (past rows and rows of perfectly good parked cars) to my enemies hideout to steal his vehicle.  But basically what I am saying is that the AI in the game is pretty stupid.
Another thing that ruins the gameplay is the tedious and repetative missions.  The game is basically open this shop, do a hit on this guy, buy that building, place guards here, do a hit on that guy... over and over and over again.  And although carrying out a ""hit"" should normally be enjoyable, as you can tell from my paragraph above I found killing people to be quite the chore.
So if all of the micro-management is now non-existant and all of the action is absolutely horrendous and silly, what does this game have to offer?  Simply put... boredom.  The game is just too easy, too simple, and too shallow.  Perhaps for the third game they should eliminate the tedious missions and make it more open-ended.  Just allow you to hire thugs and build your empire.  Also, they need to work on that AI a little.  Why do these guys get lost in a neighborhood that's 5 blocks wide?  And who ever heard of circling back around, better yet, making a U-turn while doing a drive-by?  You're supposed to shoot and then high tail it outta there!  Basically, it could have been a good game had they taken the time out to actually add some gameplay to it.","Terrible, terrible game!",993772800,11,,

I got it the week it came out, but got frustrated and bored very VERY quickly after getting into the game.

As most reviewers before me have said, graphics definitely aren't next-gen HI-DEF by any stretch of the mind, I wouldn't say they are downright worst I have ever seen but it's not anywhere near where the graphics should be on a 360.

I don't mind games where you can't take 100 hits before being killed. I loved rainbow six vegas. But, this game... the absolutely most by far frustrating thing in this game is when you are seen and if you do not manage to unload an entire clip into the vampire before it gets to you, you have ALMOST a zero percent chance of living, they hit you once and it takes off 3/4 of your life. almost immediately after they first strike you and knock you back, you are hit a second time and it is game over and time to reload the checkpoint and probably have the same thing happen again.

I will admit I haven't beaten the entire game yet. I played it for a while when I first got it but then put it away for a while due to frustrating gameplay. I have started it back up but only because since I paid 60 bucks for it I might as well complete it before I turn it in for something else.

Also, As I mentioned, it does tend to be extremely boring at times. I wouldn't consider it an action game, or at least not a very good one, Because there is hardly any real action in the game asides from your character being killed. Rest of the game is slowly walking *sneaking* around town and AVOIDING all you see. So, if you want to kill a lot of vampires, don't get this game. Get Rainbow Six instead, it's still one of the best realistic action/fps games I've played on the 360. Or even get BioShock or Stranglehold if you like action.

Not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about FFX, but the scariest part is it almost succeeds!

For those who seem to love this game (preteens and anime geeks, I imagine), let's break it down the same way you all did, only this is strictly for those who like QUALITY game play, QUALITY characters, and above all, NO JAPANESE POP SONGS OR POP PRINCESSES!

Plot: Like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another. Yuna, Rikku (most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance! Yay!), and emo girl Paine are now singing sensations in Spira! Nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success, and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres, cackle and plot in such over-dramatic form it would make the Wicked Witch of the West melt in embarrassment.

Characters: The aforementioned Yuna and Rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game. While you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in FFX, they don't have such sweet characters as Auron or Lulu to balance them. Emo girl Paine is hardly a good enough replacement. ""Oh, I'm sulky and beautiful and the world doesn't understand me. I'm going to funnel my angst into my songs.""

Gameplay: The biggest difference between FFX and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes, a much-beloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages, gunslingers, swordsmen, and other useful roles. Not so in this game. You switch between them in battle, meaning you don't stick with one class for longer than a few monsters, meaning you never associate any character with any one class, meaning they become frivolous fast. And who the hell wants to be a ""singer"" in the middle of a battle? Oh, right, preteens and anime geeks.

Music: *gag*

Overall: The darkest hour in Final Fantasy history was when this game was released. It's a discredit to other games such as the masterful FFVIII that are given the same rating on Amazon as this one.

To start, the GFX are not on par. Most likely because it was made for PS3 and XB360 and then tweaked for new systems. When the protagonist first appeared I looked at his poorly done face and hair and just thought ""here we go.""

The world may not look bad, it is hard to tell because Mordor is always dark. Seeing things is a pain in the butt. The character takes up a good 1/3rd of the screen unless you sprint. So I have this giant cloak with a little bit to the left. So much of the screen is wasted because they wanted to be so zoomed in for no reason.

In order to see more you have to sprint. This is a bad idea because at any moment you can run into a band of patrolling orcs. So it is basically move to a spot, go wraith to see whats out there, move a little more, repeat. Getting into a fight with 5 or more orcs is not recommended.

Moving into combat. I don't know if they wanted a lose your way to victory type deal or what. They have a pretty neat system in place. If an orc beats you he moves up in rank and may challenge his captain to a duel. If he wins that he moves up higher. Problem is they almost always beat you. If it were one on one it may be different. However every time, every single time I face a named orc two to three more show up. So now there are three of them and it only takes two hits for you to die. There was a certain orc that, no matter where I was on the map, would show up when I engaged a named and he would always show up when my health was low. Being able to execute a stunned enemy is nice when you can use it. However if there is more than one orc it is not worth trying. You can get through the part of the animation where you stab the orc in the heart and neck, but the other guy will knock you off before you can slit the throat and that's a no go for death. The orc will just get back up and come at you. The animation takes way too long. If they were going to carbon copy AC they could have at least got combat right.

Like most games the camera just straight sucks. There isn't a more straight forward way to convey that. I was fighting a named orc, right before my buddy showed up, and we were not even on the screen. I was looking at a rock and a shrub while we fought some where below. Try to move the camera a little and it will zoom in that direction. Try to maneuver it to see enemies and it will just move all around you like a drunk mosquito.

Another annoyance worth mentioning are the cut scenes when a named orc joins the fight. which i was getting 2 to three times per. The screen zooming into a face saying ""I could smell your blood from blah blah blah..."" can really have an effect on what you were doing. Cut scene ends and oh by the way you were countering but took you finger off the button. Opps your dead.

It's a horrible game. There is no other way to put it. WB just tried to mash a bunch of ""been there done that"" mechanics into a LotR game in hopes they could grab multiple audiences. They even went as far as to give the main guy a broken sword that is almost identical to Narsil. They wanted him to portray Aragorn it seems.

I luckily did not have any of the server connection issues others had. But even without those problems, the game has several flaws that ruin it for me. It seems obvious that EA's ham fisted DRM and DLC approach to game building is taking over, as right out of the box you feel like you are missing major content that should have been included in the $60 ""Limited Edition"".

The maps are TINY! I mean, picture the smallest map size in SC4, cut it in half, and that's about the size of the maps you get in Sim City. I laugh browsing through the achievements; some of them, like reach 1,000,000 population, I can't even see how it would be possible. I've already completely filled my map area and I barely have 15,000 people. If you were hoping for SC4 style gameplay, with massive cities and connected suburbs, you can forget it. Even Cities XL seemed to do this aspect of the game better than Sim City.

The road building is better, but they left out some key features, like filler tiles and steep grade bases for many buildings, which leave your cities looking glitchy and with empty areas around zones. It would be nice if they had some filler tiles that you could use to fill in dead space like in Cities XL. Also, the building variety is terrible, and it doesn't seem like there are any options for user created content like there was in SC4, so I'm guessing you'll just be building the same city over and over again until you just get tired of the game in a month. Although, I can bet EA will be adding ""content"" like buildings later and charging you an arm and a leg for the ""privilege"" like they've done on other Sim titles of late.

The always on DRM internet connection requirement really sucks. If you enjoyed playing SC4 while traveling, you can pretty much forget it. Sim City is supposed to be a solo activity. I can understand that some people like the multiplayer addition, but to require always on connection for everyone is just plain stupid.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. The point is, if you like The Sims, Cities XL, or Sim City Societies, you'll probably like this version as well. But if your hoping for an updated version of SC4, you'll be very disappointed, just like I am.

(EDIT) 3/17/13

OK, so after playing for a couple weeks, I've come across yet another major flaw. So the game's always on connection means that your game saves are stored to the server or something, and the game makers in all of their wisdom have decided that you don't need an option to save the game on your own, and that it will save it for you. It's hard to click on that ""quit"" button without hitting save first, your brain is telling you not to trust the game to save your work for you, but oh well, it works, right?

Well, no, it doesn't work. Lately (about 60% of the time) I've been getting an error message that the game is not ""processing correctly"" and asking if I want to roll my city back to a stable point, or abandon the city completely. So the big project I've been working on for the last two hours is now completely gone and I'm back to where I was when I started today. If only I had a save option so I could save my work. Thanks guys, that's quite a ""feature"".

I understand that people love the characters, the storyline, and the visually stunning cutscenes. There are even people who like the levelling up system, find the combat fascinating, and feel that the emotional development of the characters is well done and genuinely touching.
I am not one of them.
There are a lot of things wrong with Final Fantasy X. One of the first, and most noticable changes from previous Final Fantasies is the completely voiced dialogue. This lends itself to a more natural and immersive feel when done right, but FFX's dialogue is so poorly delivered, it is more cringe inducing than inspiring.
As though the scriptwriters felt they had to come up with dialogue to match the lackluster acting, the storyline is one of the most blatantly obvious and hamfisted statements I've ever seen in any medium, poorly written children's books included. The main enemy is ""Sin."" Please.
In regards to the game itself, the gameplay consists almost entirely of walking towards a red dot. I understand that that statement may seem confusing, but on the ""map"" on screen, there is a red dot pointing to exactly where you need to go to progress in the story. Looking for secret items? Head exactly in the opposite direction from the red dot, and you're more than likely to find some helpful items. This is not ""gameplay."" This is merely the illusion of interaction in between movies. Movies that will make you want to tear your ears off, the dialogue is so horrific.
The combat system is rote RPG fare, with subtle alterations to the norm that don't end up making it a better or worse experience. Grandia II's combat system stomps all over it, and honestly, after Grandia II, no company, big or small, should be making ""turn-based"" RPG combat systems that are as dull as this one.
The new level up and skill development system supposedly allows for character customization, but there's simply no point. Each character starts out on the grid in a position that has an optimal path, and the *only* benefit to diverging from that path is for the novelty of having your brawler actually be a weak spellcaster, and have no brawling abilities. Whee!
I played about 25 hours of FFX, before finally realizing that not only would I never bother to finish this game, I found that I hated it. Hated it with a passion. The insipid storyline, the pathetically stupid main character, the horribly written relationship between the two leads, and the god-awful, ham-fisted, ridiculous writing makes this a game that I simply cannot recommend to anyone. The fact that it's as popular as it is is a strong statement about how much influence marketing and pretty graphics have on the game buying population as a whole, and it's not a statement that I could repeat here without it getting edited.

1.0,True,"03 23, 2012",AWVCQU7QKVPXD,B0050SYZS0,Antonio Gonzalez,"I'm rating ME3 with one star ,not for the fact that it's a terrible game ,no in fact it's a great game if anything it's a little bit inferior to it's predecessor ,in gameplay ,graphics and voice acting ,though it is still a great and deeply emotional game. But the main reason I'm rating it 1 star ,it's because the conclusion of the story it's just an insult to the thousands of fans who eagerly awaited this moment for a long time. After having invested more than $260 dollars (not including DLCs) on the Collector's editions of ME1 ,ME2 and this one ,as well as hundreds of hours of game play ,just trying to twitch every part of the games to get the most out the story ,after all that I'm extremely disappointed and angry at EA and Bioware ,apparently they decided to reward us loyal fans with one of the worst possible endings you could give to an amazing series like this.

I will keep the 1 star rating until they give me what I was promised, which is complete closure to the full story and an ending worthy of the series. I say ""until they give me"" because having read Bioware's blog and other info websites, I came to the conclusion that this current ending was probably all part of a marketing experiment from Bioware just to get people talking, according to them they did not want the game to be forgettable (and so far they have succeeded) I read many articles about this ,but one of them specifically caught my attention, when an angry disappointed fan asked them ; ""Is that it ,that's all the story for commander Shepard?"" they answered ; ""Hardest. Day. Ever. Seriously, if you people knew all the stuff we are planning...you'd, we'll - hold onto your copy of me3 forever."" ""We caaan't say more"" Does this mean that they were planning all of it from day one and they are planning to give the complete ending in additional DLC? I think yes. like many of you I'm extremely disgusted with the ending of the game and I think it's not worthy of the series, but I for one will give them a chance to redeem themselves ,I want to see what they hold for us in the next month(s) with the upcoming DLCs  if they fail to deliver closure once again ,then this rating will simply stay as it is and will not buy another Bioware tittle again.

Why would I give them a chance at all? Well many people don't know what it takes to make a game like this ,it takes endless hours of work and requires a lot of sacrifices from a whole group of people ,and well they did such an amazing job with the previous 2 games and if they actually do what I'm hoping they will do ,then I'd say that is worth giving them a chance. Many people say ,how is Bioware going to fix the current ending? Well there's a theory circulating around the web that by now a lot of people heard about, that the almost fully identical endings are not the real ones and that supposedly all the events from the last minutes are happening in Shepard's mind ,allegedly he is fighting whether he gets indoctrinated by the Reapers or not (represented by the choices made in the last minutes) and that the supposed continued ending (not changing the current one) will be in either a DLC or  an update. Now ,I really have no idea if this if this is true ,but it's what people ,blogs and a few websites are assuming ,though it seems quite reasonable given the facts of the current ending making no sense and Shepard's attitude is questionable. And also, having seen what EA's greediness is capable of (by charging extra for DLC) the pieces seem to fit together and as much as I'd like to say that I will not be paying for extra for DLC ,I think I'd be lying because all I ever want is closure to the story.

I understand that some people would call me a whiner and spoiled because I demand a better ending and closure to the series ,well frankly I don't care what they think, this is how the game made ME feel and I can't help it. It just feels like Bioware rewarded us with a slap in the face for all of our time, money and support ,it feels nothing less than a betrayal. I believe that the conclusion of the story it's probably the most important part in a trilogy like this ,because it should offer complete closure, it's supposed to show you the consequences of your decisions in the 3 games and how they have affected the galaxy ,tell you how things turned out for each race. Not just have 16 tiny variations and one definitive ending with 3 colors, that's just BS, the current ending doesn't offer any kind closure and it's just unfitting for the ME standards ,it seems like a 10 year old wrote it. I don't really know what people who like this ending must be thinking, perhaps they're not as passionate as I am towards the series. Though I seriously doubt that someone who has played the 3 games (and has paid full price for them) will be satisfied with the current ending, if they are ,then they belong to the rare 1%. I've also seen a few internet reviewers that think we are making a big deal out of it ,well of course they don't actually have to pay from their pocket to play the games. We do. They do not have that same sense of loss that the rest of us have and seriously I don't care if someone doesn't like this review because I'm complaining or by my 1 star rating ,you are welcome to put as much negative feedback as you want , it will not change how I feel about the game. I will keep this rating it for as long as it takes until Bioware and EA give me what I paid for and I know that giving one star rating to a game in protest may not seem like much ,but the internet and people united seem to be doing wonders now in days.

Now ,how can I review a collector's edition when I'm this disappointed towards the game itself? well in short I would say that the items you get in the C.E are unique but nothing too special ,2 XBOX avatar items ,there's a nice hoodie for Shepard for when you are not on a mission ,a robo-dog that all it seems to do it's walk around the lower part of the ship ,the alternate look for the squad members is nice but it makes almost no difference in a firefight ,there's also a few unimportant really short missions that are almost detached from the main story ,the art lithograph is OK I guess. Although the N7 patch looks nice ,it has Velcro on one side only so it can only be added it to certain surfaces. I think what I like the most of the C.E is the the steel case, it has that cool holographic color with the pictures of male and female Shepard on each side ,so in my opinion it looks great ,so I'd say that the overall package it's just OK , the ME2 Collector's edition in my opinion was way better and it offered more in game content with better missions. I'd recommend that people should only buy the ME3 collector's edition if you truly are a hardcore fan that must have every item of the game and you have a very optimistic attitude, because after finishing the game you will need all the optimism you can get your hands on.

I am not entirely sure what happened at ubisoft in recent years but their games are horrible now. Not horrible in the sense that the game itself is bad or the idea but by how this game is applied. I bought this as a huge fan of almost all Tom Clancy games hoping this would be good as well but the bugs, disconnection problems, server errors, team killing by random people as the game starts, hacking (surprising but still happens on consoles), and the failure of the fairfight system on the game. Those are just some of the negatives. There are tons of immature kids and ADULTS in this game that are just online to be trolls. The updates that ""fix"" the game actually cause more harm and problems in the long run. My recommendation is after glitches and team killers, and bugs throughout the servers and game, stay away from Tom Clancy games now. The division was just as bad as this with its bugs and I would expect nothing less from wildlands when it arrives.

1.0,True,"06 2, 2015",ATKSZOGG28QK1,B000FQBPCQ,Cindy,"I purchased this game in hopes of getting the version shown in the picture, but was severely disappointed when it arrived in the mail as the Nintendo Selects version with the red packaging. Please understand that I am not giving it this low rating for the game itself; I already own the Nintendo Selects version and can definitely say that Twilight Princess is a wonderful game deserving of five stars; however, this particular seller is not. They have falsely advertised this product as being the original, non-""Nintendo Selects"" version produced back in 2006 when the game first came out. This may seem trivial to most, but there are many reasons why a person may be looking for this old version. My particular reason for wanting this is because the original has some features that the Nintendo Selects version does not, and by this, I mean glitches that allow you to play in areas that you normally could not reach, get to some places early, etc; however, it is also important to collectors to have it simply because it is an original rather than a re-release.
If you are a collector, or like me, are simply looking to enjoy the extra features that the original has to offer, I suggest you look elsewhere. I now regret not reading the reviews because apparently this was mentioned by a few others, but I already knew it was a great game, and up until now have never had a problem with false advertisement on Amazon. I am now returning this item,  and will definitely be more cautious in the future when seeking out a particular version like this.
That said, if you are simply looking for any version of the Twilight Princess game, go right ahead and buy it. The game is fun; I have already spent around 200 hours total on just one save file in the Nintendo Selects version, and am still playing it on occasion, even though I finished the game long ago. I have already played the game through at least ten times now, simply because the puzzles are interesting and challenging, and most of all, because I love the story. I know some people have complained that the darker tone does not work or belong in Zelda games, but I tend to disagree; the games have always hinted at a darker world that even most of the residents of Hyrule remain oblivious to, darker times that have long since been forgotten. After all, what could possibly be darker than the Shadow Temple in Ocarina of Time? Furthermore, Twilight Princess handles this style in a very elegant and beautiful way; it is not over-the-top dark in the ridiculous way that some games try to be, but at the same time, does not take its story too lightly. The characters are also quite interesting, and in true Zelda fashion, each unique and full of life and emotion. Midna in particular is a very intriguing character, with a deep and troubled past that is slowly revealed, bit by bit, as you progress through the story and Link earns her trust. Believe me when I say that the serious undertone will be a joy to Zelda fans, rather than a burden. It will not disappoint.
The Wii remote controls actually work quite well with the game, and swinging them to slash with your sword is still quite fun, even if the method is a bit more primitive than Skyward Sword, as it requires button combinations to use specific attacks. It's true that it would have been far more fun and immersive with the Wii MotionPlus' added sensitivity, but I also realize that this was the Wii's first game, and that type of additive content was not yet made available; furthermore, this game was being released for both the GameCube and Wii at the same time -- to make such controls as functional for the Wii as they are in Skyward Sword would require a lot more time, thus postponing the release, and preventing it from becoming both the GameCube's swan song and the Wii's first game, unless they were to postpone the release of the Wii, which would be, of course, a ridiculous thing to do for the sake of one game. The only complaint I have here is that the shield deflecting technique for projectiles is fairly difficult to perform, although I have no trouble bashing enemies with the shield attack. Still, I'll chalk this one little problem up to my own lack of skill in this technique, and not the fault of the controllers themselves.
In short, this game is amazing, and well deserving of five stars. Any Zelda fan would do well to buy it and immerse themselves in this beautiful journey. Trust me, I wouldn't buy two different copies of the game if I didn't completely love it.
As far as the shipping of the product, it was very fast, as expected, and I got it within a day of placing the order.
Nevertheless, I implore the seller that they update the photo to reflect the true product they are selling, so that hopefully this will not happen to any more people in the future. None of the above mentioned happiness with the game nor the quality of shipping excuses the fact that they falsely advertised their product and disappointed a potential customer.","Great Game, Wrong Version",1433203200,3,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

1.0,False,"01 14, 2014",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00CLW3TZS,Aiex Halo,"Yes, I play COD games for the campaigns, too.  I was actually drawn in and impressed by Call of Duty 4, and even Modern Warfare 2 and World at War.  I feel so silly and nave now for thinking a few years back that maybe the series would push the envelope and be a bit more edgy by setting it in places like Israel, Sudan, or Southeast Asia and involve some people other than America and/or Britain constantly.

Instead, we get this garbage bag of insanity.

To get it out of the way first, the multiplayer is the same thing it's always been since COD4.  At the very least, it has female soldiers available now and I approve of this, as well as being able to customize your soldier (within reason) and upgrade them each individually.  Also, shiny graphics, much shinier than other COD games.

But the campaign.  Holy hell.  At the very least, there is/was a history with the US and Russia that could conceivably justify a war between those two countries (despite it being played out), but the main bad guy in this game is ""all of South America""

The idea that South America (apparently with Venezuela at the lead) would even begin to take hostile actions against the United States, whether now or 20 minutes in the future where this game is set, goes above and beyond insanity and stupidity, even more so than the route Battlefield 4 apparently took with the US vs China.  Apart from the fact that ""all of South America"" and the US are within easy driving/sailing distance, the Venezuelan economy is inextricably tied with the United States---nearly 40% of all their exports go to the US, and more than 30% of all their imports come from the US.

The idea that Venezuela would be able to overcome this massive reliance on the US to maintain its economy AND acquire a cornucopia of military hardware capable of legitimately threatening the United States within the next 20 years is FANTASY.

But the game tries to justify this by claiming America has been ""weakened"" somehow, allowing ""all of South America"" to become the next superpower.  Yet despite being ""weakened"", every other mission involves you, US soldier, deploying insanely advanced killing technology like drone strikes, remote-controlled snipers, and even a killer satellite to wipe out millions of non-white people.  Granted, this killer satellite is ""stolen"" by ""all of South America"" and used to attack American cities in the prologue, but its mere existence beforehand is just begging for some pack of buttholes to abuse it with horrifying results.  This satellite thing makes M.A.D. look tedious.

Considering the high level of realism COD normally likes to take with its ""modern"" war games, this sticks out horribly as cartoon fantasy.

And of course, much of the early action involves war with Mexico, with a gigantic border wall Republicans would wet themselves with delight to see being the center stage for combat.  And despite this, and occasional NPCs on your side having Hispanic last names, every character is a big burly white man.  Everyone.  Even the Big Bad turns out to be a former Ghost, in a revelation so insanely obvious that it becomes a plot hole to even treat it like a surprise.  Somehow the dirty Hispanics were able to brainwash a redblooded big burly white American guy just because his comrades couldn't save him from a life-or-death situation that would have killed them all, meaning this guy is either a massively petulant narcissist, or incredibly stupid.

And another thing; I enjoyed the atmosphere of COD4 Modern Warfare, in part because the characters felt professional---they used military terminology, had very little dumb chatter, very little clich-ridden dialogue, if any, and largely kept their cool under fire.  In Ghosts, it's the exact opposite in virtually every instance, and comes across like a bad Hollywood action flick than a military shooter.

Normally I like replaying certain COD campaigns, picking up Veteran-level achievements as well, but IF I ever play Ghosts again, I will never touch this steaming pile of moronic pseudo-propaganda that is the main campaign ever again.",Teabagger's wet dream,1389657600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

With that being said, this is so far the ONLY game of the franchise that actually lives up to its title - being ""Guilty"" for being horrible; hands down the worst of the series.

Regardless of your fighting genre skill level going into this game, when compared to X2, Isuka is downright awful.  Mechanic-wise, the biggest and most noticable flaw is the fact that players must get used to switching a character's facing direction, an aspect that WILL find you many game overs, time and time again - simply by forgeting to press a button.  This alone is the biggest reason many fighting gamers shelf this title after several short playthroughs.  The rest of the game's features include a side-scroller mode ala Streets of Rage style and a Build-a-Fighter (using moves from all the characters).  Unique in their own way, their appeal is, however, very short lived.

The 4-player VS aspect doesn't help the replay value, either, forcing players to filter through the chaos on one screen as they switch between two linear 2D planes of the field to attack, aid or hurt (that's right) their own teammates in the process of hurting the opposition.

The only GOOD mark about Isuka? The music.  Always has been a highlight of the franchise, but overall, avoid this game.  For a better, cooler, and garenteed experience with a long-lasting replay value, pick up the more recent titles of the series, ""Guilty Gear Accent Core,"" or its updated version ""Guilty Gear Accent Core PLUS"".","NOT for the Hardcore, the Casual, or any fighting gamer.

The Wii U is fun and REALLY appropriate for my 6 year old who LOVES all the games especially Lego City. All was well until the other day when the console died. I contacted Nintendo who very promptly and easily agreed to send me a new unit under warranty. My experience with Nintendo customer service was excellent.

Once the new unit arrived I discovered the terrible truth. ALL your saved games and purchases are tied to the physical Wii U unit and there is NO way to transfer them to a new console. You can move them to external storage, but you cannot read them in another system. As a result my little boy loses all the saved games he had and is incredibly disappointed.
This is a HUGE design flaw in the way the Wii U works and is absolutely ridiculous. The idea that any engineer would sit down and design a system that has NO way to transfer saved games perplexes me. This is apparently true with any downloaded games as well but thankfully we have only purchased games on disks.

I am sure this was some ridiculous effort to prevent hacking and illegal copying of games but for me it is a complete deal breaker. I purchase all my software and don't pirate things illegally so when a copy protection mechanism is designed to screw over those of us that do things honestly it drives me crazy.

Swinging your weapon with the right analog stick is absolutely miserable and single-handly takes away any ""fun"" that the combat has to offer.

Note to game makers: Halo's controls were great and spot on. Follow what works, and has been tested.

Gameplay: OMG! Repetative! The same enemies over and over and over again, with the occassional new one thrown in to say that they atleast tried to spice the game up.

In addition, skill moves do not work against the AI, the AI never is caught out of position on tackles, the computer does not understand the offsides rule, slide tackles are rendered completely useless, etc, etc.  Also, things like Ultimate Team functionality and level advancement are ""void"" if you are not connected to EA's servers.  Again, pathetic.

Controls are a positive and negative at the same time.  The game gives you a lot of control and options but it feels like you need to be an octopus to be able to fully control the game.  On one hand, it gives you a sense of accomplishment mastering different things, on the other, the game has been nullified as a pick up and play sports game.  In other words, you cannot just pick up the game a few months from now and play like you did before nor can you play with friends who have never played before as the controls are ridiculously complicated.

Where FIFA 12 shines is really only in the on-line component.  This is the only place where the game actually feels fair and balanced for the most part.  Well, that is until you run into the cheaters.  Laggers, guys with 0.5 star teams that act like 5-star teams, glitch exploiters. It can get really sad.  Probably only 2/5 matches seem like your playing a far match.

In conclusion, I love soccer and I really wanted to love this game.  Parts of this game I really love like create-a-pro and ultimate team but in the end, I felt more frustrated with this game than I enjoyed it.  Do I suck at this game?  Absolutely not.  That is not why I have come to dislike this game.  Most of my dislike for this game comes from EA's refusal to fix problems that have been present since the beginning, EA's complete disregard for people that want to play single player, and that EA is more concerned about it's DRM than the actual game.",A big pile of flaming sh....,1320451200,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

Like all of you, I loved the price of these headphones. The reviews looked good, so I bought one.  I only used it about 6-7 times over 2 months.

From the beginning, the sound wasn't great, and it cut in and out a lot. Never having used a headset like this before, for conversation while gaming, I attributed that to WiFi or the other person's connection, etc.  Until the mic just stopped working completely.

Normally, I would contact the place I bought it, explain that the item was defective, and see how their customer service handled it.  My expectation would be that they would replace it or allow me to return it since it was defective.  I love Amazon,  and have been a customer for 20 years, almost as long as they've been in business.  Amazon only fulfilled this order,  JD Powerhouse sold it.  I deliberately picked a seller with a good satisfaction rating. So....fast forward to today.

I just spent a half hour in an endless loop of trying to return or exchange this defective headset. It's impossible to get to a screen to even report that it was broken because once you click on ""Repair or Replace Item,"" then you have to choose your order that contains the item.  Once you do that, you get:  ""This item isn't eligible for return.  The return window closed on May 15, 2015."" (30 days from my purchase).  I naively thought that was for people who just didn't want it, not people whose item BROKE.

Bottom line is I'm out about 12 bucks and I consider myself lucky that that's all it is.  This will definitely influence my purchasing, because no matter how much I spend, if something goes wrong after 30 days, I'm completely out of luck.

- audio still stutters CONSTANTLY and the game hiccups along with the stutters, usually right when you're about to like pull the trigger on a shot you've been lining up

Nope.  Reality is much more cruel.

Or B.  To download some stupid file and go through a complicated process of trying to make the damn controller work for my VERY FIRST PC GAME!

I've spent more time trying to get the controller to work than I have actually playing the game.  I've only recently given up and decided to resort to the mouse and keypad. Which honestly, is something I just don't feel comfortable with.

The biggest problems with matchmaking continue to be the game's inability to keep your party together from one game to another and the game's inability to evenly parse out teams for each match.

Additionally, as many have noted, Halo and Halo 2 are ported from their previous PC versions as opposed to the original Xbox versions. Because of this, glitches exist in these games (both single player and multiplayer) that shouldn't even be there to begin with.

Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...

What EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:

- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players
- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)
- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements
- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)
- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)
- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)
- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)
_ Throw-ins are just a joke! Players spend most of the time running after the ball themselves as if there's no one out there

Overall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.

Why do things that I once anticipated so highly always end up being the objects of my loathing? First it was Dragonball: Evolution, then recently The Last Airbender and now Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3 for the PSP system. How can a video game that boasts 50 playable characters, a lengthy story mode, and plenty of fan service be worse than it's predecessors?

I should've gathered from the numerous `mediocre' reviews that this title wasn't worth it, but Naruto games generally get bad reviews by critics (and great reviews by fans, as did this one) and my Naruto fanboy wouldn't let me pass it up. In addition, the first in the series Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes, was an absolutely great experience. Naruto UNH3 takes what made it's predecessors great, throws it away and in it's place jams 30 more fighters and the option of having 4 characters duking it out at once in team battle or free for all. Now theoretically that would be a good thing, but somehow the folks over at CC2 managed to royally screw this up. The combat system in place before was perfect, but UNH3 is a mess. 4 on 4 is too chaotic and instead of relying on skill, your main priority is to mash the O button and dash in hopes of actually hitting someone.

Story Mode:

The side-scrolling missions were annoying, nuff said...

A persistent problem in this otherwise great series is fake difficulty. By that I mean difficulty that can only be overcome not by skill, but by cheating. Yes, it seems cheating is positively encouraged. What is a player expected to do when he has no access to chakra, and the enemy has increased speed and attack power?

It's simple but fun to play and basically a nice little time with your DS. But the game is pretty much ruined by the obnoxious and unskippable touchscreen mini ""games"" (quotes very much intended) that pop up here and there and that you must complete before moving on. These little games are boring, mind numbing and so stupid difficult that they bring any and all fun to a screeching halt. A little message to DS game developers: just because there's a touch screen on the DS, that does NOT mean you have to shoehorn touchscreen elements into your games. For some games, touchscreen fits very smoothly into the gameplay and is a lovely, natural fit. For others (like this one) touch screen play feels shoved in there, in a forced, unpleasant way. It's like the developers added it simply because they felt they had to, without any though about making it organic or enjoyable within the game. Again I say: not every DS game NEEDS to contain touch screen elements. A Spider-Man game is fine without touch screen, if it's a good game. And this one IS a good game, except for the touch screen aspects, which sadly, really slow down the fun. They should have just left the touch screen out. They would have lost nothing and made their game a lot more enjoyable. They wanted everything- they ended up with nothing. Sorry Griptonite, better luck next time. And since this game is almost identical Griptonite's last Spider-Man game (which also had annoying and unnecessary touch screen elements) we know there WILL be a next time.

But, if you've never seen any of my other reviews for other Mortal Kombat games, here's why I really hate this game.

- Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the beginning of the end for the series because THIS is the game that started the trend of having WAY TOO MANY unnecessary Mortal Kombat games on the market, making everyone who used to enjoy the series SICK TO DEATH of it.

- The actual fighting in this game is exactly the same as in Mortal Kombat 3. Which means, I hate it. It's like the company knew how much I hated the direction they took the Mortal Kombat series starting with the third installment, so they decided to create more or less the same game but with old familiar fighters returning. They did this on purpose to annoy ME. If the actual fighting stinks, it doesn't matter WHO returns. It's like Midway knew they made a mistake with the original Mortal Kombat 3 by introducing people to a list of all-new fighters, but they somehow DIDN'T realize that adding combos and a run button was the main reason Mortal Kombat 3 was such an awful game in the first place.  So running around delivering combos is *still* here.  BAD move.

- I hate when something is supposed to be the complete package, but instead, when you play the game, you find out that a bunch of things are missing. That's exactly what we have with this game. It's sort of like opening up a Christmas present to find nothing but styrofoam chips inside.

That's what you can expect  with this trash game. Come on EA. You're killing it, I mean, killing your franchise!

Anyway...I can't believe what EA has done to destroy this beloved franchise. First off, know that Criterion (Burnout and Hot Pursuit devs) They did not make this game. This atrocity was made by an entity called Ghost. In a nutshell, this game is complete garbage. Oh Criterion, you are missed already... You're better of sticking in a 10 year old NFS game then play this. Read on.

I could barely get through this hour of play time.  First issue,  almost everything in this game is recycled from NFS Rivals and I wasn't a big fan of that one either but hey if the gameplay is great? Give it a chance right? But no, like others have mentioned, this is nothing but a copy and paste of Rivals.  Yea EA being EA! The B actors they hired are absolutely detestable and you're forced to listen to their tripe and these cut scenes are so bad I want cringe. You will get sick. Grab the barf bags. There's more videos of atrocious cut scenes than you are actually driving the car. Can we leave videos to youtube and not for video games? Even worse, you can't skip it. The fast and furious rendition attempts to  come into play and you'll laugh listening to these idiots, but the worst part, (nope, you can't skip it).

Anyway, when you finally get to drive, you are engulfed with obtrusive text boxes that cover the screen, while you're driving I might add and you have to constantly press B to get rid of it before you crash. After about 15 closures of text books I didn't want to read and constantly being interrupted, the driving finally comes into play. At first glance, I have to say, it's probably the prettiest night time driving I've ever seen.  The cars are purty, very well detailed, and nice cosmetical damage. But...

The good stops there.  The driving itself is borderline bad. The drifting? Um, I'll say this, ""what drifting?"" There is no drifting that I could see or pull out, I felt completely out of control of my ride.  I've felt better handling on Rad Racer for the NES.  And of course, no surprise. No Dash view hurts too, I love seeing the old dashboard in the old NFS games, none of that here. The game is apparently online online ONLY and I of course was having server issues geting into a game too.  Network lag was HORRIBLE and I kept glitching out back to the beginning of a race. I got booted out of a mission right in the middle of the game, and I just had to wait to go back.  Okay, I'm done. Thanks for the beta demo and calling it a complete game.

Play time in this game consists mainly of jogging, wandering around, shooting, taking pictures, jumping, sliding under trees like Pete Townsend, and figuring out fuse puzzles. (Yep, you read that right, FUSE PUZZLES.)

This game is very quick - with only seven levels, most gamers will probably finish it in 3 days, which is hardly worth its high price tag.

It would have been wiser for the game developers to wait and release this game 6 to 8 months down the road and give it more quality. Some of the unlockable extras are nice, but there could have been so much more to enjoy with more effort.

I went into this game with high hopes because the game got such good reviews and I'm such a huge fan, however, I came out confused and ultimately very upset. It's not like the game is a complete mess and doesn't do anything right, it's just not fun and overall unbelievably forgettable. Let's start with the graphics: At times, I felt like I was playing an early xbox 360 game, but most of the time it felt like a ps2 game or something, especially the outside portions of the game. I found them to be blurry and lacking detail. Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is atrocious to say the least. The mechanics and everything are fine, but it takes too many bullets to take down certain enemies and overall it's just very repetitive and not fun at all. I would equate this game to left for dead because the enemies come and keep on coming. They are relentless and you don't even have time to look around at the environment. This game is not even in the same league as halo, so don't even say it. Now, I would go over some other things in the game, but if you're like me then the gameplay is probably the most important thing and you already know how I feel about it, so I will leave you with a list of my favorite fps games of all time and you can see why I thought this game was crap. These are in order starting with the best. 1. Goldeneye-N64, 2. Perfect Dark-N64, 3. Red Faction PS2, 4. Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor Underground-PS1, 5. Bioshock, and Bioshock Infinite- XBOX 360.

When I picked up my 360, I thought, okay, now, which games do I really, really want to see in Hi-Def? So, I picked up the Big Three: Madden, Fight Night 3, and the, unknown to me at the time, one-star wonder that IS NBA Live '07.

I expected to lose, I realize that when a new game version comes out. But, you get used to the changes, adapt, and go on your winning way.

Not with this steaming dog turd.

Like many have said before, the camera angles make it hard to keep track of the action, and the computer just takes over the game. I've played it over and over again, even with teams ranked lower than mine, and the opposing team always makes almost all of their shots, and their players are faster than mine. I swear they run like they're knee deep in wet concrete!

The graphics are great, but who cares if the gameplay stinks. I was hoping they would change the foul shooting mechanics for this version, but no. So, if in some miraculous instance YOU get fouled instead of the other way around, don't plan on nothing-but-nets.

The three-point shooting is abismal, and defense is nonexistent. One of the things I loved in the game was stealing the ball, and cutting into a fast break. Not in this game. For some reason, you can't stay in front of your man, and if you lean in too far, and get dodged, your guy stumbles about three steps, and leaves his man open to charge the net.

And if you do get a fast break going, your guys are so slow, the other team is on your heels or have one or two guys at the net by the time you get there.

I bought the wireless version of 360, and actually thought it was a problem with the signal getting from the controller to the box.

Nope.

A lot of effort went into this, you can tell. It's beautiful to look at, but playing it will make you want to pull your hair out by the roots.

It's just another hack n slash, but, the worst thing about it is there is no improvement on equipment. Weapons, Armor, Runes, magical items, shields, etc. all remain the same as in the origional. That +15% weapon you got in Prophecies is still as good as the +15% weapon you get in Nightfall and/or Factions. Without player/character improvements this series is destine for boredom much faster with each rendition.

  Once you have leveled up at least one character to level 20 the repitition is tedious and boring to say the least since it requires going thru the same content over and over and just hacking and slashing your way thru it. It's an experience grind, but, there's no other reason to level up since there isn't any improved equipment to be had.

  I grew bored playing Faction and were it not for the Alliance battles and the fort battles I would have quit playing the series a long time ago. Adding Heroes to the game does nothing for me except add more ignorant Ai performance during battles although it does allow me to keep them in place while I pull....about the only improvement worth Nightfall purchase.

  Bottom Line if you have the others and only if you play the non-pvp portion of the game will you really get anything of value out of this expansion. My suggestion is just wait until the price falls as it already has by $10 I see. It's just not the mmorpg that it should be. If they would separate pvp from non-pvp and allow players to progress in higher levels and equipment this by far would be an outstanding non pay to play game.

Then, I graduated to ""land"" where once again I had to run around collecting food and finding things.  This wasn't what I had in mind at all. I'd say I played for about 3-4 hours and when I was done, I just couldn't believe I spent 4 hours running around collecting things.  This is ""first person"" where you are the creature you create. You have to go around singing to other creatures, and doing some dance for them.  If they are unevolved creatures they will be impressed with you and you will get points, or advance your species, so you can go back and put better ears or horns on it or whatever.  You are in charge of the evolution but to evolve you ahve to go around collecting things.

Graphics I don't have a gripe with so I'll skip that. Dialogue in my opinion was terrible. It was extremely static and just felt scripted. Regardless of the fact that it was. It didn't really give me a sense that people were talking as opposed to that they had lines they were supposed to say. Storyline and setup was equally terrible and overused. A main character with amnesia?! And they just left it that way? The main character never even had presence... at all. He just said ""huh? ok..."" the whole game (with exception to battles when he first puts on one of the rings). Also you don't get to know anything... ANYTHING about the characters until their specific chapter section comes up (which is really sad because I never got to feel attached to anyone) and once their story is done you don't get anything else from them anyways. Next is the way that the plot and surprises were released. Everything was pretty much centered around one lead character and for some reason ""he knew everything but never revealed any of it until after it happened"". He even says he knew when things were going to happen but chose not to tell anyone. I know some of you will say he had a perfectly good reason but it's quite possibly the easiest way out of giving a good excuse for keeping information back.

Don't bother buying unless you are you willing to put down the extra money for a OpenWheeler Racing Cockpit.  First of all, you need to brace this wheel down with the clamp underneath.  I thought we would use our wooden tv tray (it is pretty heavy)...no, it doesn't go over the brace pieces underneath, so it is leaning very far forward and gets the tv tray off balance.  Next, the pedals will not stay where they should be, I even tried putting a rug mat under them but they still move with normal pressure.  Also this is NOT Bluetooth or wireless. The USB cord is maybe 4 foot long and if you have your Xbox in a console with your other tv components, you are sitting right in front of the tv.  Just not the greatest setup.

On a positive note, if my husband held the steering wheel in place, it was actually really fun to place with the driving games and pretty responsive.  That is also not a realistic setup.  So for me, without buying whole lot more toys, this just isn't a reasonable a purchase.

Cons:
Not wireless..USB cord is about 4 feet long.

The combat system is a great halfway point between your typical hotkey MMOs and an action game, it's fairly stationary, but it feels good and it works, everything flows well and feels polished and it's a very pretty game that always manages to run well without high end hardware.

The problem? Well... The rest of the game sort of ... sucks.

-The questing is bad by decade old standards, every class and every race has the exact same progression and the first ~30 levels are agony. It is a standard Korean hypergrind just to get to anything resembling good content.

-There's no meat anywhere to be found in any subsystems or unique designs. If you're a person who likes to really tinker and really explore some good character building and other side elements, prepare for a wasteland because while the basic combat is cool in an MMO setting there's NOTHING to prop it up.

-Class design is extremely vanilla. May as well just call it Nuker, Tanker, Healer. Next to no variety or creativity in skills or design, another thing that makes a giant dent in a good combat system

-The interface is rather crap, filled with bloated baubles and arcane methods and descriptions (often wrong) and just outright missing core elements you likely saw back in the dark ages of the genre.

-The narrative and characters are awkward and off putting. It's that special grade of Korean high fantasy where everything just comes across as creepy and everything makes a B-tier type presentation look legitimate.

-It's also very.... fetishy. Prepare to enter a world with nothing but busty elves and lolita bunny girls but I won't hold that against it, I'm just too used to this stuff as an Asian RPG fan. If you want those unique values and settings you'll have to put up with the fact that these games cater to a lot of perverts.

The bold design and customizable glowing lights look great in comparison to many other mice out there. The mouse also comes with a CD that allows you to program and set up different profiles for various games or programs that you will be using. I personally use this very often and find it very helpful when transitioning from gaming to work. The side macro buttons makes working on my computer much more smoother as now I just have to press one button rather than press multiple keys in order to make an action or access a file. The only downside, which is completely based on personal preference, is that the side macro buttons on the left side of the mouse is really hard to use. Something else that you might want to be aware of is that the ROCCAT Kova[+] is actually quite lightweight in comparison to most gaming mice, but it shouldn't really change your over all mouse
experience unless you are specifically looking for a heavy mouse.

2.0,False,"02 23, 2013",A1FZI1F22GRO4C,B0009HAXFQ,Richard Veysey,"I have enjoyed (to some extent) every Myst game that preceded this one.  As a kid, I played through Myst, tried to play through Riven (there was a stupid bug that wouldn't let me get to a very crucial plot location), and, in more recent years, went through the other three titles in the series.  Although Uru was odd and occasionally frustrating in its quests (especially in 'Path of the Shell' where solving the big puzzle requires finding little hints hidden in really random places) it was, in the end, a rewarding experience.  Though I have not yet finished 'End of Ages', I am  thoroughly disappointed.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the worlds don't have the vivacity that they had in previous games.  Even Riven was full of living things, movement, and atmosphere.  Though this game is full of the series' trademark beauty, any life to the art seems purely incidental.  Anything that looks cool generally is just there as a decorative touch rather than seeming like a living part of the landscape (and mystery) of the ages.  I think the worst loss in this regard comes in the joy of seeing the way aspects of the environment eventually played a part in the adventure.  In every Myst game before this one, there would be objects and locations scattered across the ages that you might see, but not know the reason for.  As you got closer to solving the bigger puzzles, these aspects of the environment would come to life, and suddenly everything was connected, and it was generally pure genius.  In each age in 'End of Ages', I found large contraptions and interesting locations that were, if anything, minor stops along the way.  There was no moment where everything came together (Myst 3 was by far the best example of these) and it makes each world just seem boring in hindsight.

The worst thing about this game, however, is the tablet.  When you start exploring the ages in this chapter of the saga, you find mysterious creatures that respond to a stone slab located in each age.  You can pick up the slab, draw on it, and drop it.  In most locations, once you step away from the tablet, the creatures will take it and react to what is on it.  In each age, solving the majority of puzzles involves drawing various symbols on the tablet.  Unfortunately drawing on the tablet is difficult unless you're an MSPaint master or something and generally you'll need to either copy the symbols to paper or memorize them.  Often times you'll think your drawing is close, and the game won't accept it.  Often you'll find this out fairly quickly and try again, but in certain instances you won't know that the game hasn't accepted the symbol until you travel to a completely new location.  Sometimes the creatures will even take the tablet and put it somewhere else you've already been in the age.

I am nearly finished with the game.  The plot is interesting, and for that reason alone I will try to complete it.

For a start this is a universal remote so you can control more than just the playstation with it however there are problems.  After entering the code for my Samsung TV, not all the buttons would work as advertised, for example search and channel list.  So you end up having to go back to using your Samsung remote.

As for the playstation itself it is quite hit and miss.  If you just want a remote to control your DVD/Blu Rays then this works fine however if you want to use this remote with other apps then you start to run into problems.  It does not work at all with Youtube. Play, Stop etc. don't work with the Amazon app.  What you end up doing is using the Sony keys (square, traingle) etc. just like you would on the dualshock controller.  So why have all these other buttons when they don't work half the time?

The remote is quite a bit thinner than the old PS3 remote and with the length of it you find yourself constantly have to move the remote around in your hand or use two hands to get to all the buttons.

Another niggle I have is that none of the buttons are backlit.  This isn't such a big deal but it would have been a nice have, especially when you are watching a movie in a darkened room.

Overall this remote is a bit of a hit and miss.  If you are mainly buying this for Blu Ray playback functionality then I would recommend it.  If you want to do more with it, like controlling apps then I'd just stick with the dualshock.",Doesn't work properly with a lot of apps,1447372800,,,

As much as I wanted to show Harmonix that there really is an audience for this much-awaited sequel, all I ended up doing was reassuring them that they could release a half-finished product that in no way is a worthy sequel to 3. Even if you managed to get the right instruments (I did), there's no guarantee they're working properly, and while they do support the automatic sync that the later instruments for 3 introduced, you're still probably going to deal with lag, which means playing on Hard or Expert is not going to work well.

Of course you'll have to play the standard songs because your DLC won't all transfer yet, even if you want to take the time to download every song individually (confirming that the Xbox Live Marketplace is just as terrible on the Bone as it is on the 360), a large percentage of them won't show up as previously purchased. Harmonix is at least admitting there's a problem now - on launch day it was ""contact Microsoft or Sony."" Right. I'm sure I'm the only customer who got 25% of his DLC licenses transferred.

If Harmonix can get all of these problems worked out - and unlike Neversoft, they have a history of doing so - then I might get this out and play it again. Until then, it was a waste of my money, and it'll be a waste of yours too.

UPDATE: Here we are, months later, and it turns out that Harmonix did manage to get a few problems sorted ... but there are others they never really did get to. Most of my DLC seems to have transferred, but of course not all songs are available due to what I'm guessing is the inability to retain licenses for them. (Not that there's any place to find this out.)

The game itself isn't bad, and at its best, it does address a couple of the glaring weaknesses with RB3: you're not nearly as encumbered by sets entirely from in-game music (the new feature that lets you vote on what to include is cool), and the career mode is significantly longer. However, it introduces a number of other issues, many of which came down to releasing 50% of a game at full price and then gradually adding features as time went along.

There's also the problem on the Xbone version that combines Microsoft's Apple-like quest to make you replace everything every time and Harmonix' puzzling decision to allow PDP to release only a small amount of adapters for those of us with ION Drum Rockers for the 360. Because the standard drums are garbage (especially with the cymbals attached - those are even cheaper than the drums), your only option now is to stock up on drum kits so that when one of them breaks you can just throw it away and open the next one.

Overall, I'm really regretting my decision to buy it for the Xbone; I didn't really get enough carryover value to justify that purchase, and it doesn't seem like Harmonix is really invested in supporting my part of their customer base. It's too bad, because at its best, the Rock Band series was amazing.

Spider-Man: Friend or Foe attempts to put a different spin on the Spidey/brawler formula, but sadly, the end result is pretty disappointing, and above all, it's pretty lame.  Friend or Foe begins with an interesting enough premise: someone is using symbiote-controled villains to wreak havoc, and head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury has recruited Spidey to take them on and team up with his various rogues in an attempt to take down the mystery villain behind it all.  Teaming up with the Green Goblin, Doc Ock, and more?  It sounds great on paper, but what kills Friend or Foe is how ungodly boring the game's action elements are.  Beat up one group of baddies, move on to another, repeat.  This is basically the whole concept of Friend or Foe.

The Bad: Clumsy and cumbersome controls, boring levels, lame objectives, no mid-level save, unfair checkpoint placement, flat ugly textures

Oni was a very hyped anime style game back in the day. This game was made by Rockstar before getting into the 3D Grand Theft Autos and other games. This game has a lot of potential, but is flawed in a lot of ways that make the game more boring and frustrating than bad. With that said, the only redeeming quality are the good-looking combat animations and challenge.

Right out of the gate you will notice that the controls are completely upside and backwards. All the combat moves are on the shoulder buttons. Why in the world they thought of this is beyond me. You actually don't really use the face buttons all that much. This make jumping, fighting, and shooting clumsy and cumbersome and you can't change the controls to something more natural. These are just some of the worst action/adventure controls I have ever used. The actual combat is fine, but executing these moves is a pain. I felt like I was stumbling over myself because I had to think about the controls. These just aren't natural! Jumping with R1, L2 and L1 are kick and punch, and you pick up items with R3. What?! I felt like I was trying to solve a Rubix cube, not play a game.

Secondly is the exploration factor. The levels are boring. They all look pretty much the same with flat boring textures and the design is confusing and labyrinthine in some levels. There's no direction and your compass is useless. The bar gets smaller as you get near an objective, but if you are two flights down it will act like you're standing right next to it. Enemies are stupid and clumsy, boss fights are frustrating, and the game just can't compensate its own design with the clumsy controls. I can't tell you how tired I got after just three levels of finding this colored console to open same colored door over and over again.

The story isn't really worth sticking around the 14 levels either. The anime cut scenes are nice, but you probably won't even get through this slog of a game. I tried really hard to keep going, but there was never a change in pace. It didn't help that there is no mid-level saving and the checkpoint placement is unfair. If you quit in the middle of a level you have to start all over. There are just a lot of annoying things with this game, but even if it was flawless you still have the fact that the game is just boring and not very fun.

When it is all said and done only the hardest core of anime fans will stick around until the end. You really had to have played this when it first came out, then come back for nostalgic purposes. The game is just clumsy and boring, but has so much potential if only the developers spent more time on the game.

A 5 hour campaign, firefight mode that requires you to invite 3 other of your friends on live to play with, multiplayer maps that have already been sold on xbox live as downloads.  What makes this game worth 60 dollars?

This is by far the worst Halo in the series.  The storyline is terribly broken, which switches characters and missions constantly, leaving you without a hint of immersion.  I had no idea what I was doing until 3 hours in the campaign, only to be switched to another persons perspective.

The big sell point of this game was also of course, the firefight mode.  I have yet to get more than one person in a game for this mode since xbox live friends are more for show than to actually play with.  I understand the novelty of getting your buddies to link up their xboxes to play halo, but that was 5 years ago.  It's time to open up coop gaming to random people.  I hate how Bungie is limiting my experience of Halo to how they think I should play it.  It's my friggin game, stop telling me I can't play campaigns with a random person online!

Cons:  *ALREADY coming apart at a key place --> the magnets that connect the keyboard platform to the padded lap section have begun to detach [description below*]; having the keyboard all the way to the side creates the need to shift the device away from a centered position to type comfortably; lack of a lip to the top of the mouse area allows mouse to slide off easily in that direction placing additional stress on the mouse cord & connection; USB hub randomly cuts off recognition of one of the devices (keyboard usually), usually when computer is idle, requiring me to unplug it and re-plug it in to resume normal function -- so far this has always worked and doesn't happen often.

Despite being an old game of only 1.5 gigabytes or so, the game ran smoothly, with units moving in formation automatically, looking quite smooth and small.  It is still gratifying to see villagers hit a tree with a few axe hits, then see the thing keel over and stay on the ground until it's been fully chopped, or to see dying units stay on the field, gradually disintegrating into corpses, then into nothing.

There's nothing wrong at all with the engine or the animation or anything.  It was fun and highly entertaining.  The thing that drags this game down is where all strategy games should shine their brightest: combat.

A single Greek Hoplite takes up 2 population points, with each house providing 15 population points, each town center about 15-20 (I forget) and you receiving a limit of 10 houses on a map, and only as many town centers as there are villages on the map (which as as sparingly placed as gold mines), so you're never likely to have an army bigger than a few dozen units at a time.

But you're never likely to get 50-60 or even 100 units on the field at once.  The higher up you progress on the unit scale, the more population each unit eats up.  None of the units is particularly effective against other units save to bash at them for a minute or so before their target dies.

The mixing of mythology and reality in the game is almost seamless, but there's still a sense of disbelief to it, and when even the most basic Myth unit overpowers some of the toughest Human units, it pretty much becomes a literal ""Age of Mythology""

Battles will be decided mostly by myth units.  It doesn't matter if you've amassed an army of hundreds of basic infantry, because a wave of Colossi, or Dragons, or Anubites, or a spell like Meteor, Lightning storm, etc will wipe them out in minutes if they are in big enough number.

God powers are another thing that are grossly overpowered.  While it's absolutely beautiful watching meteor strike smack into an enemy base and leave giant craters while temporarily flooding the area with light, it's a bit much to see almost the entire selected patch of an enemy base crumbling before a single meteor strike or earthquake or whatever.  Granted, you can only use this godpower once per level, but who needs to use it more than once?

Myth units get progressively stronger as you upgrade and select different Gods to worship and gain their respective powers, upgrades, and myth units, but in the end all infantry and cavalry are rendered useless before the might of the myth units.  The same problem that plagued Red Alert 2 plagues this game.

Goods:

- Simple, yet smooth and beautiful graphics make the game fun to watch.

- A complex array of units awaits those who wish to fight with humans rather than myth units.

- Units speak their native languages (Greeks speak ancient Greek, Egyptians speak ancient Egyptian, Norse speak some sort of Scandinavian).

- Easy and steady interface makes it user-friendly and not a mad rush for resources or a mad rush for infantry.  Slow and steady could actually win you the race, if you're playing wisely.

Neutral:

- Myth units are a bit garish in their style and size.

- God powers can be used only once, which is good for some (like meteor or earthquake) and bad for others.

- Buildings can take a long time to break down, requiring siege equipment

Bad:

- Myth units are grossly overpowered, and render human infantry useless once into the midst of the game.

- Strict population limits and high unit population cost means combat will be limited and no more than 80 units can be fielded by one side at a time.

- Repetitive nature of Myth units and God powers makes replayability a myth in itself.

- God powers are souped up superweapons, with an earthquake capable of leveling an entire enemy base of all its buildings save for town centers, fortresses, and other heavier buildings.

All in all, it was a fun game to play at first, but replayability is not a realistic thought.  Myth units dominate the game (which some would argue they should, being as the name of the game is ""Age of Mythology"", but it does so at the cost of human infantry entirely).  If myth units are designed to be the elite in this game, why bother with so much work on an extensive and quite complex selection of human infantry/cavalry?

That appears to be my only major problem, but it's a big one.",What is the purpose of such a massive game when Myth units dominate all others?,1038182400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The nostalgia of playing in tournaments back in the day for the original tekken tag is not enough to carry this game, it's a very similar feeling to going back and playing an old nintendo game you used to love... Fun at first, then frustrating, then you just move on to something more enjoyable and fresh. TTT2 has all the same combo's and exploitable bull-ish all the previous ones have had, and the graphics are about the same as they were in T6. The controls are unresponsive, the bosses are cheap as usual (though Jun isn't quite as bad as that demon bird wannabe aztec god at the end of six); and as usual, the customization items are ridiculously expensive, causing you to ""grind"" the game to gain access to them. Which would be less of an irritation if any of the pieces were rewarding. The clothing looks ridiculous, the models are sub par, and the new ""com-bot"" portion is not only unoriginal, it's just not fun.

I would say that unless you're just a hardcore Tekken fanatic wait for the price to drop. If you're not really experienced with the series, and are just thinking about picking this up for ""the lulz"" you could do worse, but I'd suggest you keep looking.

2.0,True,"01 15, 2011",A1YS02UZZGRDCT,B001D7T2VM,Evan Eberhardt,"I loved the idea of this game.  The Horseman War in battle?  What a great concept.  Well, the concept is the only great thing about this game.  What the makers decided to do instead of making a pure fighting game was instead create a mutt of a game that incorporates WAY too many aspects, and, big surprise, hardly anything is done well.  Darksiders is basically a fighting/adventure/puzzle/exploring game topped off with a story that other than using a Horseman of the Apocalypse has no other bearings to the Book of Revelations or anything else from the Christian myth.  Yeah, does that sound like trouble to any one else?

So, the fighting.  Oh boy, what a mess.  I am a Ninja Gaiden fan (1 &2) and consider these games the apex of how to make a fun fighting game.  Both of them compelled me to play all the difficulties, including Master Ninja, which is unbelievably difficult to accomplish.  But the fighting is so fluid and fun that the challenge is worth the effort.  Then there is a game like Darksiders that is the exact opposite of my beloved NG games.  The fighting schematic is so thin you will be bored within a couple hours.  War's sword is the primary weapon and you use the X button to control it (plus, some RB and direction pad moves).  The combos are all pretty short and become tiresome quickly.  You can purchase more moves (by collecting souls), but most of those were yawn inducing in no time too.  War also has a secondary weapon that is either a scythe or a glove.  The scythe is okay, but again the combos are very limited.  The glove, however, is a joke (and a dumb weapon idea).  On top of this, War also has a throwing star and a pistol (yeah, a pistol, with infinite ammo no less) for long range attacks.  Both are so weak though that they are essentially worthless except for very specific uses.  The enemy's AI is okay, but the fighting becomes SO repetitive that by the end of the game I was just running past battles.

Then there is the adventure aspect of Darksiders.  This too was fouled up.  The controls are not very well made for this aspect and this was by far what I disliked the most about this game.  War has the sorriest jump of any game in recent memory.  War also has the sorriest double jump as well.  Plus, the game is notorious for having unresponsive controls when you jump from an edge and instead you just drop to your demise like an idiot (I must have fallen a couple hundred times, really annoying in general and insanely frustrating on some of the puzzles).  The game makers decided to add a winged feather option to float War down softly if need be after a jump as well (this feature is handy, but it does add yet another control to remember).  Then War also has a grappling arrow and a portal gun (plus the throwing star that is needed quite often) to make his way through the dungeons and landscapes.  The problem here is that War is so clunky that these maneuvers are often a battle of controls and do not feel intuitive (or fluid) in the least.  And there are so many tools put into use here that it simply overloads the game and bogs down any fun in the process.  Plus, War often needs to be in a closer 3rd person mode to do all this stuff (by clicking the right analog stick...I think, can't remember).  Then suddenly you are fighting and forget you are in the close in mode which is yet more annoyance.  Anyway, just suffice it to say that Prince of Persia was way simpler and more fun for an adventure game where lots of exploring is involved.  Heck, so was Crackdown for that matter (lots of running and jumping, but done in a fun and fluid way to keep one interested).

The Puzzles.  Let's just say the puzzles were too easy or if not too easy, then made hard because you are trying to jump to a tough spot and keep falling or are hanging from the ceiling and something snatches you, etc.  More frustration than fun because of the clunky and way too complicated controls.  I typically do not like puzzles in any fighting games because they nearly always suck, and Darksiders is no exception.

The exploring.  The world is decently sized in Darksiders with plenty to look at.  Too bad exploring it is such a chore since War isn't the least bit nimble.  Plus, this game falls into the worn out tactic of having to revisit areas as you acquire more tools.  It even has you go all over the place to find pieces for a required sword right before the end of the game.  Maybe it's just me, but I hate revisiting maps to explore areas you couldn't reach before.  It makes me feel like I am being forced to replay stuff I already did just so the makers can add extra game time.  Yawn.  You do get to ride Ruin, War's horse, at certain areas of the world, which is nice (although war's horse is supposed to be red according to myth legend, but it is black in the game).

The story.  This is where I was really scratching my head.  I am not a Christian, but I enjoy some of the myths of the religion when used in fiction (the Exorcist movie for example).  Darksiders has no relation to anything from the Apocalypse myths that I am familiar with except breaking seals and War the Horseman.  There is heaven and hell, but they are mediated by a neutral third party called the Council that keeps the balance or something.  Huh?  I don't know who thought up the story of the game, but it isn't good.  Samael makes an appearance, and is a key player in War's journey, but I didn't quite get what he was doing in the story (he is the angel of death in Jewish lore).  It is like they decided to use War the Horseman, but then just made random crap up from there (including a huge Scottish blacksmith called Black Hammer that I think is a deity, maybe).  Anyway, you get the picture.  I just see a blown opportunity here to make use of a Horseman in a game.  And speaking of War, he is a paper thin character, given absolutely no depth at all.  Why do we care about our hero/anti-hero (I don't know which he is)?  Beats me.  Plus, the tone of the game is uber serious which only makes it seem that much more ridiculous.  A game like Bayonetta is also ridiculous, but that was done on purpose for the most part (plus, it is a tongue in cheek style).

To sum up, Darksiders is trying to be way too many things and winds up being pretty bad at them all.  A jack-of-all-trades, master of none experience overall (except jack is too high a compliment...fool is more appropriate).  Bayonetta is a FAR more enjoyable game because its fighting engine is pretty decent and its controls are nicely done also.  Ninja Gaiden 2 blows this game away for its pure fighting, wicked gore, and combo depth (I highly recommend it, but only if you have patience because it is one tough mother of a game).  Prince of Persia is also superior for an adventure/explorer game.

The Bad: Extremely dated visuals with slowdown and bugs galore, potty humor that is somehow unfunny, broken movement, poor hit detection, lame weapons, same formula repeated over and over again, why bother?

Man where do I start. From a movie directed by the anti-Christ of video game movies to a game series that just refuses to improve on itself (whether on purpose or not is a mystery), Postal is just one terrible game series. Why Running With Scissors keeps making these stupid games with no improvements is beyond my comprehension.

Postal tries to shoehorn in raunchy and potty mouth humor, but does it in a way where it's not funny. How that is possible is a mystery as well. From using porn actor Ron Jeremy's likeness to dumb ideas like rampaging social justice soccer moms crashing porn shops, porn star signings, and other conventions with the lead mom looking like Sarah Palin. These ideas are dumb and should never exist. It doesn't help that Postal III tries to poorly copy Quintin Tarantino's art style. If playing as a guy named Dude and running around trying to help people, but constantly failing because he ends up killing everyone, sounds fun this game makes it unplayable.

At first it didn't seem so bad during the tutorial until you realized the game has poor hit detection. When my reticle is over something and bullets don't go anywhere near it, that is a serious issue and lazy game design. I honestly doubt RWS even play tested a smidgen of this game. On top of all this  they used the outdated Source engine so the game looks over 5 years old. There are even sounds and effects pulled directly from Half-Life 2! Movement isn't right either like it's still in alpha. Not to mention some of the weapons in this game are just dumb. A vacuum that sucks up garbage and launches it? This isn't Ratchet & Clank. Throwing feral cats? Using your own pee as a weapon? Not only are these stupid ideas but they aren't even done right!

The biggest issue is that everything is so mundane. Each ""level"" consists of the same thing over and over. Just run around killing these people. Nothing ever changes and it doesn't help that the game is really hard and enemies respawn until you complete the goal. How a developer can screw up this bad is just unheard of. It feels like Uwe Boll himself made this game despite the developers making fun of him in the game. Postal is a homeless person living in the streets of the game world and some people stop to talk to it, but realize that it is just a foul mouthed unfunny piece of crap. Absolutely no thought or effort was put into this game.

There's not much else to say, but don't play this or you will regret it. I wasted a whole hour trying to like this game, but just couldn't. Do yourself a favor and play any other game but this one.

Long time One Piece fan here and let me say, reviews like this fooled me into thinking this was a great game for my fanatical side. It is not, despite its attempt at fan service this game is repetitive, its lazy, its so non-linear, and of course coming from bandai/namco its a polished piece of turd with a license slapped on it so it seems okay. I had a MUCH better One Piece experience from Pirate Warriors 2 over this, the only thing this has over pirate warriors 2 is the visuals. And that's it.

The open areas are hardly that open and secret areas need a special character to unlock and those characters can't unlock said secret/secret area without a word(s) found to give them the ability. This was one of the stupidest things I've ever dealt with. For example: You play as Zoro who we all know master of three swords, cutting through enemies and making tornadoes (by the way the dragon twister in this game looks epic but its pitiful how little damage it does and how fast it vanishes) yet come to a steel gate that he's supposed to cut, oop can't do it because he needs this item or whatever that is a word(s) to give him the ability to cut a gate WHEN HE'S BEEN DOING NOTHING BUT CUTTING THROUGH STEEL FOR YEARS!

Still not convince this is bad? The animation though somewhat smooth and I do like the visuals. But everyone moves way too slow, like what the hell? Are they all training on a Kai's planet or something? Did they forget how to walk? I can't condone a slow moving and even more slow fighting mechanic, I like fast paced action and that's the stuff I got from PW:2 over this heap of crap.

Addendum:
To be fair, this is a great game; both the PC and 360 versions, according to [...] ([...]), both versions scored 90%ish in aggregate reviews from major sites. In addition, the limited installations and security measures may not affect users who don't upgrade their system very often or only play the newest, hottest games once and move on.

However, I usually purchase my games for the long term and I have installed games years after they're released. So again, for longevity, I prefer to own my games rather than ask permission to play them later.

Addendum 2:
I finally purchased it from Steam last year, after they dropped the DRM on it. Yes, Steam's acceptable to me (we all have our lines) but anything more from a third party is not, as Steam has at least demonstrated that I can install it on different systems as long as I'm using my account.

2.0,False,"12 23, 2008",A6VI02LR3Z3BW,B000X9FV5M,Moxibustion,"The original FarCry is still one of my favourite shooters of all time. FarCry2 whilst having a  similar title, is however something of a departure from the original FarCry. The plot seems based on the book 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, whereby we see western characters bringing moral chaos into Africa (the games setting) through gun running and other activites. You are sent in to this setting with the mission of killing the Jackal - the chief gun runner and arms dealer causing this moral chaos. For those that have seen the idea portrayed in the film 'Apocalypse Now' you will get the idea. This plot is revealed through finding tapes that reveal the Jackals descent into moral darkness along the way in similar fashion to how the plot developed in Bioshock. Despite the same name as the original, FarCry2 is a whole different game, perhaps closest in concept to STALKER. FarCry2 is a giant sandbox whereby you get to do whatever it is that you please and tackle the game in any manner that you want, very similar in concept to how STALKER functioned. STALKER was a fantastic game and should be played by anyone interested in shooters and first person style RPGs. FarCry2 however fails to implement the elements needed in quite the same fashion as STALKER and the game quickly becomes boring and repetitive. There are almost no RPG elements that stalker has and so the tasks that FarCry2 asks you to accomplish become pointless and unimaginative. The world that is created is missing a few things, like civilians, and people living their lives, refugees and hence offers you no reason to feel at home in the enviroment, build a house, or setup a base (such as you might do in Oblivion and like). The world is populated by people that simply want to kill you, they will attack even if they have no chance of success and so in the course of the game your moral compass will shift from seeing if the person is a friendly to murdering people in their cars with flame throwers so they won't irritate you by running you off the road. In this sense the game actually succeeds in advancing the plot so you find the 'Heart of Darkness', but not because of the storytelling, but because everything in the game is so annoying that you just want it to die. As much as I wanted to like this game I found myself playing it to completion for the sake of liberating my hard drive space for something better - never a good sign. How come nobody can do a remake of the original FarCry but update the graphics and add a bunch of new levels or something. How good would that be. I am starting to think that the original was a fluke. The games magazines give this an impressive rating, meanwhile the gaming community has panned it - why do we still buy those magazines.

Stability: Stable, for the most part other than the X-Fi problem. If you have an X-Fi and an nForce chipset then many have experiences snaps and crackling with the sound. I had this problem and could not resolve it. So if your system is suspect to this as mine is then FarCry2 is the worst affected that I have found. Other than sound I did not experience any crashes whilst playing in 50hrs of gameplay.

Graphics: Inevitably this is going to be measured up against Crysis. Is FarCry2 as impressive as Crysis in the graphics department - nope, but I would argue that it is good enough nonetheless. It is similar is quality to Half-Life 2, but perhaps closest in look and feel to Soldier of Fortune Payback - for those who played that game. FarCry2 is slightly drabber that the brighter and more sprightly look is SOF Payback, but the feel is the same. I enjoyed the environment for the most part even if it got repetitive after awhile. Overall the feel and look of the environment is well done, though doesn't vary much like FarCry The Original did. The irony is that SOF Payback might be the better game.

Sound: Apart from the X-Fi problem I mentioned the sound track fits quite well to the environment and doesn't ever feel annoying or out of place. However the sound affects are only better than average, though the atmospheric sounds do their job. There is also a sound positioning problem for those running 5.1 setups however the patch designed to fix this didn't work so well for me.

Gameplay: This is the problem area. Whereas STALKER managed to mix the sandbox idea with an RPG system, with sound and NPCs really well as well as immersing you in a believeable environment, FarCry2 is really a let down in this department. The weapons never really improve, you cannot upgrade your car, you never develop any real friends in the game and the gameplay is a snoozefest. My wife was watching over my shoulder one night as I was playing and she said 'Isn't this boring?' Couldn't have said it better myself. FarCry worked because it kept the open ended part of the game only big enough to allow variety in how to get to an objective. STALKER worked because it allowed RPG elements that affected what you could do in the game and gave incentive for going out and exploring and becoming enveloped in the story. FarCry2 does neither of these things, it just gives a massive gameworld with nothing interesting to do it. No villages to save, no homes to make, no affecting the game in any real way, just tedious driving and console like diamond hunts. Doing console tasks on a PC is a drag, as is FarCry2. The game might have worked better if you went down a long river and got to upgrade your barge without having to go anywhere twice (Apocalyse Now anyone?) Too late to speculate now.

Length: Took me about 50 hours (including wasting my time finding all of the diamonds - a  pointless task since you get more than enough money). This is a good standard by today's games, howeever one has to question whether is is 50 quality hours. I argue for the negative, Farcry2 has its moments but these only amount to about 3-4 hours worth.
Replayability: I didn't bother with multiplayer as I have no friends who own the game, and  perhaps they are wise as they wish not too. If you find clipping your toenails to be exhilirating then this could be the game for you.

Verdict: 2.5/5. In the end a mediocre effort, an impressive presentation but lacked fun. A far  cry from the original (pun intended).

Obsidian didn't do enough test playing here.  After weeks of gaming, all of a sudden my game freezes up all the time.  I can't go more than about three minutes without my system freezing.  It freezes when I save, leaving corrupt files.  It freezes when the level is too big or there's too much action hapening (which is always).  Looking at various blogs, every site lists glitch after glitch after glitch.  Characters showing up and not talking when a dialogue screen pops up.  Glitches with lightsabers.  Trouble with characters in your party getting killed when you spar them to advance the story line.

Perosonally, I've tried everything to fix my lock-up glitch, but I pretty much have to flush my 42 hours and start over.  Not a pleaseant prospect.  I haven't seen this many glitches since I played Enter the Matrix on Xbox last year.

Aside from the glitches, you'll also be a bit lost at the story line.  You're playing a character with memory loss, and the interaction and discussion with other NPCs never really fill you in.  It's a good 20+ hours before any of that back story starts to make any sense.

On the positive side, I love the game play.  The new prestige classes and lightsaber forms are sweet.  The improved interface, the new powers and combat options, those are great, too.

2.0,True,"05 25, 2008",A3W4NLU1LAA153,B000FPOJOS,Chris L,"Right up front, I'll point out the three most obvious things about GT5 Prologue.
1. It looks gorgeous
2. The AI is abominable.
3. There is still no car damage.

To use a lovely english expression : it's all mouth and no trousers. Look past the HD graphics and hype and you'll find Gran Turismo 1 lurking here.

The Gran Turismo games are known for their accurate car handling and fantastic graphics, and GT5 Prologue is no exception. The problem is that it is all absolutely ruined by the other driver AI. Previous Gran Turismo titles have never exactly shone when it comes to the AI, but in GT5 it's simply non-existent. It's not that the AI is dumb, it's just not there. The other cars all drive on rails, irrespective of where you are. For example, on the High Speed Ring circuit - there's a challenge to get from the back of the pack to the front in a single lap. In the car they give you, it is 100% impossible to come any higher than 3rd, and that's a stretch. The driving-on-rails is so accurate and predictable that you can actually predict exactly where every car will be at any given point. You'll come up behind the Ford Focus at the end of the second turn, and don't even think about passing him on the outside because he will always jink to the left for no reason as he goes across the bridge. If you're in the way, then tough. The game will just force you off the track. At the next corner, the Mazda 6 will always follow the identical line inside the corner, again irrespective of whether you're there.
The same is true in the other types of race. Within minutes of playing this game, you will find yourself making a tidy corner only to have a much faster car come right up behind you and ram you off the track because you're in the way of it's pre-programmed line. To see how truly awful it is, start a race at the back and watch the 15 cars in front of you. They'll all cut the same corner in the same way, every lap, all with the identical puff of dirt as they do it.
It is simply abominable.

The problem is that this issue was solved long ago by the likes of - well - just about every other racing franchise out there. It's compounded by the fact that there is still no car damage or dirt in GT5. You can stuff any car into a concrete armco at 175mph and it will simply bounce off without so much as a scratch. To think that Polyphony could put out a game with no car damage and ruinous AI on a next-gen console in 2008 just boggles the mind given how accomplished the competition is (think: Project Gotham Racing).

So what about the eye-candy aspect? Well - it runs at 1080p (full HD) and it looks absolutely spectacular. The textures are crisp and don't blur out at highly obtuse angles like they would on an X-Box. The car models are beautiful as are the various effects like the real-time reflections and the colour-flip paint jobs. There is some aliasing on high-contrast areas but detail popup is minimal. There are very noticable level-of-detail swaps on some of the cars where they swap from a low detail to a high detail version. It's most noticable on the Daytona circuit where you'll occasionally see the shading on the back of a car pop noticably as the model swaps to it's higher resolution version. In fact the eye-candy aspect is only marred slightly be the fact that the game clearly doesn't run at 60 frames per second. Well - it does on sparsely populated tracks but in the thick of the action on some circuits, you'll see noticable slowdown which you just shouldn't have on a console as powerful as a PS3.

What other things to know about? Well the online aspect of the game has a lot of promise but it's buggy at best. If your PS3 isn't set up pefectly on a broadband network (NAT type 1) it just won't connect to the servers. If you're lucky enough to have a good setup, then even when it does connect, the racing is a bit dodgy. It's obvious that the sample rate for your system communicating with all the others is fairly slow as you'll often see your opponents cars jump across the circuit from one side to the other, or suddenly appear to brake or accelerate at light speed as the servers catch up.

When you come to use the game for the first time, be prepared for a long wait. It seems to copy the entire blu-ray disc on to the internal hard drive which takes a good 15 minutes, then as soon as you connect, it will download a huge update which will take 5 to 10 minutes to download and another 5 minutes to install. So out-of-the-box to first race is about 30 minutes. That seems a bit odd to me - I was entirely expecting the game to run off the disc like many of the other PS3 titles.

So GT5 Prologue : it's great eye-candy, sure. But the two biggest, most long-standing problems with the GT franchise are still present. Awful AI and no car damage. The press previews and talk from Polyphony indicate that the full game will have car damage, but historically, they've never been known to change their underlying game engines between the 'Prologue' and the full versions of GT. They have always claimed that they've fixed the AI with each successive version of the game, but honestly - GT5 Prologue has taken a massive step backwards. They say it's better than ever but it's actually worse than ever. So when they say there will be car damage in the full game, I say 'cry wolf' I'm afraid.

It's an ominous omen for GT5 later this year. Sure it'll have more cars and more tracks. But chances are it will have the same problems the GT franchise has always had, and that's simply not good enough. Couple that with the questionable frame rate and online problems and that could be disastrous.

I dearly love the GT  franchise - I've had every one of them and I've been hoping and praying that they would one day fix the AI problems and the lack of car damage. If they've not done it on the PS3, then it's just never going to happen, and that is a sad indictment of Polyphony's marketing strategy. I've played this game a lot, desperately wanting to like it but I always put the controller down and am left with an empty feeling. It's just not exciting.",Different console.

2.0,False,"05 24, 2012",A3KFPY78H49K8Z,B00178630A,C. Boeshaar,"Okay, this game is just AWFUL. And this is coming from someone who spent over 100 hours on it and beat the game on Inferno with my Wizard so I've given the game more than its fair chance.

The first couple of times of beating the game are very fun, especially with friends, I will hand it to Blizzard. The art is nice, the music is not bad, and the environments are somewhat interesting.

Then you reach the brick wall that is known as Inferno (the hardest difficulty) and you realize what Blizzard has been planning all along.

The mobs in Inferno suddenly become godlike and all your gear becomes instantly obsolete. Elites and even regular mobs will kick your ass unless you upgrade your very quickly.

To make matters worse the game PUNISHES YOU for playing co-op on Inferno, the already disgustingly difficult mobs become near godly and unless you and your friends are supremely geared it's going to be an excruciating exercise in futility.

Problem is that 95% of the loot you get in Inferno is literally garbage, so bad that even the NPC vendors will be reluctant to accept them. Magic find increases the chances of getting yellow items, but chances are they are still crap.

There are far too many possible attributes during item rolls, so as a result you will almost always get items which make no sense whatsoever (example: Wizard hat with Strength, or Barbarian sword with Intelligence, etc.) and weapons in Act 4 of Inferno with 200 DPS. It's infuriating.

It is so bad that when I killed Diablo on Inferno he dropped only blues, and not just any blues but TERRIBLE blues, stuff so bad you wouldn't even use it on Hell difficulty.

So you're thinking to yourself, WHY WHY WHY would they do this?! Why make the mobs so difficult and the gear so bad?!?!

WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE REACH THE GOAL OF BLIZZARD'S GAME DESIGN IN DIABLO 3: THE REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE!!!

As stated Inferno is so ridiculously difficult and the loot generally so bad that the ONLY WAY to progress is to use the Auction House.

I only managed to beat the game by bidding low gold on items and shopping intelligently, but it took wayyyy longer than it should have. Not only this, I was BASICALLY FORCED TO USE THE AUCTION HOUSE TO BEAT THE GAME.

Trust me this isn't just unique to me because I suck, 90% of my friends gave up at Inferno Act 1, those that stayed have had no choice but to use the Auction House as well. The game isn't skill dependent, it is only gear based.

PROBLEM IS that the gold prices of items have flown through the roof due to inflation, botters, and exploiters. So expect to see any half decent weapon for at least 10 million gold, which is no small amount of money.

So a lot of people have resorted to using the Real Money Auction House and it's absolute chaos. I've seen people spending over $500 (yes real cash) on a SINGLE ITEM, a virtual item folks that will probably be obsolete in the next patch or expansion.

I personally don't believe in spending real money on video game items (especially absurd amounts like stated above) but to each his own.

-----

So I really can't help but feel like the entire game was designed to revolve around the Real Money Auction House. The difficulty is absurd at inferno, many of the bosses are basically gear-checks (can only be beaten with certain amounts of DPS) and the loot is so bad that you have no choice but to use the Auction House.

This game is a money grab, it's pay to win, and I'm not sticking around for when they implement Player vs. Player where it's going to be the battle of the credit cards.

I will admit that I got more than my money's worth and it was fun at times, but this franchise has been ruined and this is by FAR the worst Blizzard game I have ever played. I will not remember this fondly like I do Diablo 2 or the Starcraft Series.

Clearly there is a interesting world here, too bad they never attempt to do anything with it, there was a great chance for some outstanding storytelling, but it never happened.

So we are left with a very expensive Multiplayer only game. However, for the price tag, you would think there was a epic campaign tacked on, So I guess I don't understanding the price point.

Now on to multiplayer, it's fun at first, for one or two hours. Then you realize how annoying the AI bots are in matches (well you notice that in the first five minutes but Titans make it fun for the hour or hours). They pretty much stand there and let you shoot them. Through all of that mess, you have to find and kill six other people. This game design choice was crazy. Swarming AI bots, but only 6 vs 6 players? A person got paid for this kind of decision making?

The textures on this game, leave much to be desired. Sure it's an alright looking game, but feels stuck in last gen.
The guns do not have recoil, and that really threw it off for me. Also you are talking about a 50gig (or 48) download which is crazy. .

Also there is an extreme lack of maps, which Is another insane detail for the price point of this game. Not to mention they all feel the same.

I won't sit here and pretend, there isn't a good thing about this game. The Titan's and their gameplay, are amazing. Very impressive what was done here. They feel better than the pilots themselves to be honest. I can't help but tip my hat to this aspect of the game, because it's a lot of fun. When you jump out of one, it does make you realize how sad it is, the rest of the game pales in comparison, to their greatness.

If you only like multiplayer, no campaign, lore, then you may want to try this game out at some point.
But the looming 59.99 price tag for a multiplayer game, is just too high. I feel sorry for people who bought, the deluxe version or the collections edition.

So I would rather give it a 2 star instead of 3. Firstly, I want to say that this game is somewhat enjoyable. However, it has repetitive gameplay (that might have redeeming qualities through online), and boring some even annoying characters.

In case you don't want to read the whole thing. The characters in this game are very generic. If you're looking for depth of character, or plot... This is not the game for you. The gameplay is boring, but online makes up for it slightly. If you're interested in the fan service, this game has A TON of it. however, most of the girls' bodies look the same. This is the game I play in between other releases.

After reading all the reviews in different sites and seeing player feedbacks I thought I'd give the game a shot. I went into this game thinking it has a battle system similar to Gundam vs Gundam. This game is more like dynasty warriors with less moves, and equally bad camera controls.

One of the game's selling features is the fan service. As a person who spends time watching anime here and there and thoroughly enjoys Bandai Namco's ""Tales of"" series (which is filled with cliche anime plot and characters), this game features the most annoying and boring cast of characters. I refer to both how they look, sound, and act.

All the characters have unique face and hair, but they all have the same grotesquely large breasts. You have a few flat chested girls here and there... A large majority of the cast have really fake voice acting. All of them technically have unique personalities, but it's personalities common to your typical harem anime. So the shy quiet girl, preppy energetic girl, emo, slut, etc.

The plot isn't that much better, but I can't comment on that since I started skipping the story half way through the first school I played.

Outside of boring generic characters, the game lacks solid gameplay. Each girl has a unique fighting style, but a majority of the time, you're going to be pressing square. Occasionally you'll press circle to follow an enemy or press triangle for a guard break. The combat is very similar to Koei Tecmo's Dynasty warriors so it'll feel like a button masher most of the time.

So after all the bad things I mentioned you're probably wondering why this game has such great reviews? Do I think it's awful, no. I spent a good 20 hours before it got boring. Even then, I still play it every once in a while. The key selling point to the game in my opinion is fan service. Maybe the fan service is there to cover up the rest of the game. The game does what it's meant for, interactive fan service. It's entertainment, and not very expensive. It's not a bad purchase. However, if you're looking for a good game, this isn't it.

I am a huge PS3 fan. While the console is not perfect, the system has plenty of games almost for anyone, regardless of the age. The only thing that still was driving me crazy is that once I moved to PS3 I stopped using my PS2 games and just because the new consoles are not compatible with older ones.

Knowing that the 60GB old units can play both type of games (PS3 plus PS2) I took the chance. However, the unit worked for about 24 hrs and after that, it refused to play  PS3 games again, caput, dead! It worked for some of the PS2 games I have, but sporadically, which made me believe it was a console issue not because my games. The console was taking the disc without any issue though, you can even heard the spinning disc inside, but the system was not playing the disc's information at all, nothing.

So ... I wanted to give the unit a chance :-)  ... and because I received it during a weekend, I had the whole Sunday and part of Saturday to troubleshoot the problem and see if it was a software issue, not hardware (unlikely, but really wanted to try)

That weekend the wife got little or not attention from my side :-) I performed a full system format, quick reset of the console settings, tried bunch of games and even manually clean the discs myself, hoping it was some scratched disc  ... I did everything possible that was not hardware invasive, you name it ... and nothing worked! I literally spent my whole weekend on the issue but the unit never played a single PS3 game ever again. Actually, after a few hours it also stopped playing PS2 games as well, which the console was reading hours before, sporadically, but it was.

After Google this a bit more the Monday after, I found that this is a typical problem on most of these older units. The PS3 games are Blue Ray discs; the laser and circuit that is in charge of reading that is prone to problems so if that part or parts stopped working, you ended with a unit that will only read and play older PS2 games, which are not Blue Ray discs of course. It can be fixed replacing that part in the motherboard, but I do not have the time for that. And to be honest, I would not recommend anyone to spend extra bucks and time fixing a unit that in computer terms is ancient and already obsolete.

Long story short, I returned it to Amazon. Thanks God the seller was Amazon Prime endorsed and while it took few days, I finally received my money back.

I guess that I will have to display and connect my old PS2 box to the same T.V that I used for my PS3 console, different port of course. Or resign myself and send all those PS2 games to ""Play Station heaven"", aka trash can, where they will rest in peace for ever.

This review probably would not hold true for hardcore/professional video gamers.  I have played all of the classic Mario Bros games, and loved them all, except for this one. For one reason, and one one reason only. For the casual gamer, controlling Mario in a precise manner is an exercise in futility. If you only play your games a couple of hours a week like me, if you are not a ""pro,"" the human language cannot describe just how much this game will frustrate you. I mean it, the control is HORRIBLE.  For those of you over the age of 21, try to imagine this: You're very very drunk, and trying to walk down an ice covered slope. That would be EASIER than controlling Mario in this game, in places where it matters the most, precise maneuvering in tight spots. You can't use the control pad at all, just the joystick.  With all of the brilliant minds working for Nintendo, I would think that they could have developed a better way to control the character through the use of the control pad.  Another thing.

(This is a review that I originally wrote on 12/20/2004)
--------------------------------------------------

The first Backyard Wrestling game (subtitled ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-t-Try-This-At-Home/dp/B00009YEJV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don't Try This At Home</a>"") received poor reviews from just about everyone who played it, so you'd expect for Eidos to learn and make a better sequel. Of course, you'd be wrong. Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes The Neighborhood (BYW2) is pretty much the same as BYW1, for good and for bad.

The Basics

The game includes 25 playable wrestlers (all unlocked from the start) and 5 CAW slots. Of the 25, only 4 are female: Adrienne Pain, Sunrise Adams (adult film actress), Tera Patrick (adult film actress), and Tylene Buck. The other 21 are male: Andrew WK, El Drunko, Kelvin Finn, Luke Hadley, Madman Pondo, Masked Horn Dog, Messiah, New Jack, Ruckus, Rude Boy, Ryuji Ito, Sandman, Shaggy 2 Dope, Sick Nick Mondo, Sonjay Dutt, Supreme, Vampiro, Vic Grimes, Violent J, and Zandig.

A big problem with the game is that there's very little to do in it. Up to two players can duke it out in a 1-on-1 exhibition match, or a single player can go through the Career mode (you can have up to 10 saved careers). That's it. There's nothing else to do. One of the reasons WWE games are ranked so highly is because they give you a wide variety of match types. This game is just one match type: 1-on-1 hardcore. Although the game tries to give you the impression of variety, the entire game consists of you playing this same exact match over and over and over again. There's no reason a BYW game has to stick to non-ring-based action. Heck, watch the BYW Videos in the game's Media Room and you'll see that 95% of the action in the real-live events takes place in a ring. There should be the following match types: tag team, handicap (not the fight one guy then the other ""handicap"" match that this game has as it's career finale), lumberjack, steel cage, Hell in the Cell (though they'd have to use a different name since WWE probably has that copyrighted), plus the non-ring hardcore action. In short, everything you see in a WWE game should be here, but with the violence and blood turned up to the EXTREME! The rings should have regular, barb wire, and electrified ropes (player's choice). There should be thumb tacks, barb wire bats, panes of glass (they should be held and set up like tables in a WWE game), and other assorted ""ultra-violent"" weapons. Tables should not be part of the environment (they're ""Enviro-Mental Throws/Attacks"" in this game). They should be items you can pick up, place somewhere, stackable, and do moves onto - like you see in the WWE SmackDown! games.

Loading times throughout the game are 15-20 seconds each, but they happen right before every single opponent, plus short ones before going back to the menus. I shutter to think of how many minutes total of loadings you will sit through by the time you're done with Career mode.

Create-A-Wrestler (CAW) sucks, which is sad because you're forced to use it for career mode the first time you play it. There are so few options that I can practically list all of them here. There are only 6 body types: 4 male (athletic, muscular, overweight, slim), 2 female (athletic, muscular) with 16 different skin tones (most of which are useless unless you want funky colored wrestlers). There are 6 different face styles for each gender. There are 7 different hair styles for each gender with 16 different hair colors (again, most are rather funky). In terms of clothing, each gender has 18 upper body (shirts), 18 lower body (pants), and 6 footwear (including bare feet) choices. You can choose two different colors for each, assuming the piece of clothing has a base and a stripe.

Rounding out the CAW options are a few custom logos/tattoos, a limited selection of moves, and 35 mostly useless CAW accessories that you can buy for $200 each in the shop section of Career mode. How useless are they, you may be wondering? Take a look at this list and judge for yourself: Top Hat, Cowboy Hat, Football Helmet, Do Rag, Skater Helmet, Headband, Bowler, Visor, Sun Hat, Beanie, Beret, Headphones, Hard Hat, Baseball Cap, Ear Muffs, Biker's Helmet, Sunset Shades, Round Glasses, 3-D Glasses, Eye Patch, Painter's Mask, Clown Nose, Corn Cob Pipe, Bandage, Big Ears, Tiny Shades, Left Arm Band, Double Elbow Pads, Double Wrist Bands, Gauntlets, Biker Gloves, Bandoleer, Messenger Bag, Backpack, Bow Tie, Single Gun Belt, Double Knee Pads, Shin Guards, Wallet Chain, Tool Belt, Knee Brace, Spurs, Leg Garter, Studded Belt, and Snow Shoes. Nothing says ""I'm a hardcore brawler, don't F with me"" more than a guy wearing a Bowler hat, 3-D glasses, a clown nose, and a pair of snow shoes. To the game's credit, though, a few of these looked great on a gal wearing the default thong outfit (cowboy hat, biker gloves, and leg garter).

On top of that, you can't even delete CAWs. The best you can do is revert them back to their default appearance and moves, but the CAW slot will still be filled - even after you've deleted your Career save and the CAW no longer has a use. Also, you can't import CAWs from another game save/memory card.

Besides the CAW accessories, the game has a few other unlockables, but they're really not worth the effort to unlock. If you can manage to make it through the game tedious and boring Career mode, you get the option to play it all over again, but this time with one of the in-game wrestlers. Since the story is exactly the same as the first time, there's nothing new to see by playing it again with an established character instead of the CAW you used the first time. As an added bonus, completing Career mode also unlocks all of the ""Game Videos"" in the Media Room. These are the same video you've seen throughout season mode (actually, each one is unlocked after you view it in the course of your career).

These videos are only marginally better than the ones you can buy from $1000 each in the shop. The five purchasable videos are short highlight reels of these wrestlers: Zandig, Ryuji Ito, Sick Nick Mondo, Vic Grimes, and Sandman. Before you get too excited, you should know that they each run a mere 35-40 seconds and contain no audio at all. In fact, almost all of the ""BYW Videos"" in the Media Room are 35-40 second audioless highlight reels. These are the same clips shown on the main menu. However, there are more clips shown on the main menu than there are in the Media Room. All of the main menu videos should be viewable in the Media Room, where they're displayed full screen. I, personally, would have rather watched the clips of the ladies (Tylene Buck, Tera Patrick, and Sunrise Adams) in the Media Room than a clip of Andrew WK singing, made pointless by the fact that there's no audio in it.

The only ""BYW Videos"" that have audio are three relatively short music videos and the promo/newspiece (""Pulse""). I have never seen a wrestling match from BYW or any of the other feds represented in the game. It would have been more beneficial for them to include one or two whole matches, instead of all these pointless, short, and mostly audioless video clips. Maybe *that* would get me interested in buying one of their videos.

The ""Pulse"" video is a TechTV story about the game and a wrestling event held to promote it several months (?) before its release. One of the game designers proudly mentions that BYW2 was the first wrestling game with confirmed online capabilities. There is no online mode in the final product. Oops!

The design of the different fighting areas is pretty good overall, though of course, some are better than others. I, personally, like the Office because you can break ALL of the cubicles in the middle of the room, and when that's done, you're left with a TON of weapons and one open area to fight in.

Gameplay

The game engine is essentially the same as in BYW1, but with a few additions, such as submission holds and a block button. There's also a new type of environmental attack, appropriately titled an ""Enviro-Mental"" attack. You can perform these attacks when you have your opponent in a front grapple and you're positioned in the right spots of each fighting area. You'll know when you're in the right spot because an exclamation point inside a triangle will appear on the screen. All you have to do is press the Triangle button and a cutscene will pop up showing you doing an extreme move to your opponent, like powerbombing him through a picnic table, hitting him with beer bottles, or frying his face on a fast food grill.

The problem with the environmental attacks, as with ALL attacks, is that the wrestlers don't sell their moves. They'll pop right back up on their feet as if you just blew air in their face. In WCW Kevin Nash once sold a finger poke to the chest as if he had just gotten hit with a bowling ball, yet here they act like nothing happened if you repeatedly slam their head in the truck of a car. The only time wrestlers act like a move really hurt them, is when they MISS a move that THEY were trying to perform.

One of my biggest grievances about the game engine is that reversals require guesswork, not skill. When in a grapple, you have to guess which of the four face buttons your opponent will use for his next move, and press it before he does his move. This is just like the reversal system introduced in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Smackdown-Shut-Your-Mouth/dp/B00006IJJF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Smackdown Shut Your Mouth</a>&nbsp;in 2002 (in that game it was the four d-pad directions instead of the face buttons). A lot of people apparently hated this system (such as me), and it was changed to a much simpler 2-button method (one for strikes, one for grapples) for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-next-WWE-game-in-2003/dp/B0000AHOOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the next WWE game in 2003</a>. Why BYW2 would use a reversal system that wasn't even kept for the WWE games is beyond me. (I don't remember if BYW1 used this reversal system or not.)

Career Mode

The meat and potatoes of the single player experience is the Career mode, which replaces the short Talk Show mode from BYW1. The Talk Show mode was boring and repetitive, and guess what? Some things never change.

The story is simple enough: The Backyard Wrestling ""federation"" has come to your town with a $1 million prize to anyone who can plow through the competition and win all the regional championships.

Career mode consists of ten fighting areas. The first nine are grouped into three sets (or tiers), with the last area being the locale of the finale. Each of the first nine areas contains five ""missions"" and five ""challenges"" each, with the last in each tier also containing a Title Tournament. The finale area contains the final five challenges. Thus bringing it to a grand total of 45 missions and 50 challenges, plus 3 title tournaments.

Not everything is unlocked from the start. You need to complete one tier in order to unlock the next, and the tenth and final area is unlocked after the third tier. The game has a rather confusing way of setting this all up, so I'm going to try to explain this as simple as possible. Please try to follow along. I'll use Tier 1 as an example (it contains the Backyard, Trailer Park, and Pool areas). You can play all 15 missions (five per area, remember) in any order you want. However, you must complete all 15 in order to unlock 12 of the 15 challenges (again, five per area) and the Title Tournament in the Pool area (the last area in each tier has the tournament). Completing the tournament (four matches total) not only unlocks the next tier (set of three areas), but also unlocks the three Title Defense challenges in the Backyard, Trailer Park, and Pool areas (one defense per area). If you lose any of the three Title Defense challenge matches, you have to play that tier's tournament all over again to reclaim the belt. This whole procedure of completing all 15 missions and the title tournament is required for all three tiers. It's quite possible that you don't even need to do the Challenges, but I did them anyway, so I can't tell you for certain.

If this all sounds like it makes perfect sense, it's because I explained it to you and you didn't have to figure it out for yourself using the rather disorganized menu in the game. The game doesn't even do anything to signify that you did all the missions and challenges in an area. You'd think they'd put a big X over the locale on the useless ""why is it taking up space on the screen"" map. Anyway, if you think this doesn't sound so bad, wait until I tell you specifically about the missions and challenges.

MISSIONS

You are given a specific objective for a match or a series of matches. Some of these include: performing a specific number of reversals, using a Weed Whacker three times, or just avoiding your opponents attacks 20 times. For objectives like these, you don't even have to go on to win the match. Once you perform the objective required, you can just quit the match and go on to the next objective. Later in the game, some objectives will require you to win a match within a set period of time, win a match with more or less than a certain percentage of health, or just to fight without using certain moves. Obviously, in these cases, you actually DO need to finish the match.

Some of the missions are downright stupid. No one in the right mind would do what they want you to do in a normal match on purpose. I mean, who really would want to finish a match with less than 10% percent health, if they didn't have to? Since I hate the reversal system (as I've previously mentioned) you can imagine how thrilled I was when I had to reverse 20 moves as one of the mission objectives.

These ""Missions"" should be in a separate ""Challenge"" section outside of career ala WWE SmackDown! Vs. Raw, with unlockables earned for completing them. They should NEVER have been made a required part of completing career mode.

What makes the missions even harder is that the game doesn't specifically tell you how to complete them. I rented this game, so I had no manual to give me the controls. I had to rely on the information given on the loading screens. While this is good most of the time (and I made sure to write down the controls as fast as I could - though the few screens repeat often enough that you'll get all the info down soon enough), the game has a nasty habit of giving you loading screens that don't relate to the objectives for the match you're about to play, or giving you the information you need AFTER you need it. For example, I played a mission in which I was not allowed to grapple, so guess what information was on the loading screen before the match? Yup, the grapple controls. Better yet, there's a mission in which I had to perform a Guard Break (I believe that's what it was). The game decided not to tell me how to perform the move until *AFTER* I quit the match out of frustration (it was on the loading screen that takes you back to the menu).

CHALLENGES

The five goals almost always are as follows:

* Fight a real wrestler. Sometimes you'll be required to finish him off specifically with a knockout, pin, or submission. On two instances, you will be forced to ""hunt"" for a specific wrestler: The game will give you several matches with random jobbers, occassionally giving you the wrestler you NEED to fight, and if you beat him three times, you complete the challenge.

* Fight a jobber (a freaky-looking CAW), who will then by replaced with a real wrestler.

* Win three matches in a row.

* Win five matches in a row.

* Defend your title (unlocked only after you win the tournament).

From what I can tell, the challenges are optional, as it doesn't seem like you need to do them to progress in the career (I did them anyway, so I can't say for sure).

The challenges are what should have been required for career mode, as they make more sense within the context of the story.

At this point you should have realized that the ""Missions"" should have been called ""Challenges"" and vice versa.

Graphics

The graphics are decent, but nothing more than what's required to get the job done. I've read that they're better than what was in BYW1, but without doing a side-by-side comparison, they don't look that much better to me.

A nice touch is that a wrestler who is repeated pummeled will have blood stains all over his body by the end of the match. Sadly, the blood stains look like someone drew lines on them with red marker. There's no dripping blood, hence why I call them stains.

Sound

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-SmackDown-Vs-Raw/dp/B0002RQ3KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE SmackDown! Vs. Raw</a>&nbsp;(SVR), the game features wrestler voice-overs (used in intro/outro cutscenes and a few Career videos only). For the most part, they are done by the real people, though the following use substitutes: Sandman, Vampiro, Kelvin Finn, Ruckus, and Adrienne Pain (I'm not sure if those last three are real people or characters made specifically for the game). Also just like SVR, the voice acting is really bad.

A big problem is that the sounds of impacts, punches, weapons, and the such, all sound very flat and underwhelming. There are also times when a sound effect should be heard, but isn't. This completed undermines any power that a move should have.

Some of the artists on the licensed soundtrack include: Insane Clown Posse, Andrew WK, Kool Keith, Bad Brains, Body Count, and Hoobastank. So if you're into that type of music, you're sure to love the very large soundtrack (there was over two and a half minutes of music listings in the end credits!). I, personally, didn't like the music in the game, so I turned it off. That's not to say the game didn't turn it back on itself every now and then. Speaking of glitches ...

Glitches

I've encountered many of them while playing the game. Some of them are pretty bad and could actually make you lose matches or missions/challenges. Here's a small list.

* Because I don't like the in-game music, I turned it off (by setting the volume to zero). Every now and then, while in Career mode, after a match, as it autosaves my game before going back to the menu, the music would come back on. It stays on while I'm on the menu, only going back off when the match loading screen appears.

* One time in the pool area, and MANY times in the restaurant area, I found my character inexplicably walking by herself towards the bottom of the screen. She would not move in the direction I wanted her to, and would only stop her migration to screen bottom if I held the block button or got into a move with my opponent.

* If doing a move on a ledge (like in the pool area), you may end up doing the move without even touching the opponent. Sometimes both characters will even shake violently like they're having a seizure or something.

* Wrestlers will sometimes fall out of grapples and teleport to standing positions in another part of the fighting area.

* The enemy artificial intelligence is also quite bad, and I don't think it's because I had the AI Difficulty set to Low. Almost every time a match started in the junkyard area, my opponent would run straight to the red van on the right and just keep running into it for a few seconds.

I also came across a glitch that prevented me from getting 100% completion in Career mode. Office: Challenge: Title Defense never becomes selectable (it's always greyed out). I had no problem playing the other eight Title Defense challenges. I completed career mode with 45 out of 45 missions completed and 49 out of 50 challenges completed.

I didn't even get all ""opponents seen."" I would think that the game would have shown me all of them by the end of career.

Play Time/Replayability

If you use cheat device codes (like Infinite Health & Turbo for Player 1, No Turbo for Player 2), you can probably work through career mode in six to ten hours - if you don't get bored first. If you play it straight, then it'll take a lot longer due to all of the stupid tasks the game forces you to complete. That's if you don't become bored AND overly-frustrated and just give up on the game altogether.

Replayability is practically non-existent for a single player because if you do complete career mode, you will NOT want to play it again with the newly unlocked option to use an in-game wrestler this time. And even if you did, it would be the exact same season you played through the first time.

Of course, two players will get a little more replayability out of the game, but not much more, because there's only so many times you can play a 1-on-1 match against each other before you both get bored. It's not like there's a plethora of areas to fight in, anyway. If you do one match in each area, after 10 matches, you will have seen them all.

I hope you like staring at a black, white and gray screen for hours at a time because that is about the only colors you are going to see throughout the whole game!!!

Ever play a first person shooter before? Nothing new here. I am not going into the minutiae like some people do. Here is the whole picture synopsis.

This game offers something different in the way of weapons and the movements of your character. You do and don't get the typical machine gun. Yes, it is a machine gun but it feels and sounds solid and futuristic when playing this game.  Your movements are interesting. You can cling to, duck behind and walk along walls for cover like you have always wanted to. Peek out, shoot around the corner then duck back behind it.

Sadly, that is the whole scheme of the game...peek, shoot and duck. Wash, rinse, repeat. Thankfully, the enemy will try to flank you, run right up to you and throw grenades at you. That definitely keeps it exciting.

Tell you more about the grenades? OK. They are cool looking, they are powerful and the throwing system is unique. And it is also very disappointing! You hold your Mouse 2 button to create a ""throw path"" for the grenade to follow. When ready, you click the Mouse 1 button to throw it and BOOM! This works great when you are on level ground. In many cases, the camera angles for the throwing system completely prevent you from seeing where you are throwing the grenade. Effectively neutralizing your aim. Also, you can only carry 4!!! Yes, a measly 4 grenades.

Which brings us to ammo. There are no health power ups or armor power ups to go hunting for. You automatically regenerate these when you are not being shot. AWESOME! Ammo is abundant and you can pick up your dead enemies weapons, allowing you to switch weapons and stock ammo to your hearts content. Again - AWESOME!

The biggest SUCK factors of this game are as follows -
Video is excellent but the colors are only gray, black and white.
Game play is fast and fun but it gets repetitive.
No save system. Checkpoints....YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The game is entirely scripted so you know when the enemy is coming every time.
When you die, you are forced to go through some of the same cut scenes over and over!!! Some can be skipped, others cannot!!!!!
It feels like they ported it from the XBOX 360 instead of making a solid version developed specifically for the PC.

Overall, it was OK. Not bad, not great. I played a friend's copy so luckily I did not have to actually pay for it. I definitely don't think it is worth $45. Maybe $30.

---------------------------------------------------------
-  The game is developed by a German company. The guide is written by the developers, so it was developed in German. Brady would never publish this drivel. First off, Someone gave 4 stars to a guide where every 50th paragraph is in German? Really?
Sometimes, a whole section is in German!  I didn't find that helpful, sorry. I have the 2010 first printing of the guide. Can anyone verify there is a corrected (full English) guide out there?  This is a very complex game with crafting and stone fusing and magic cards, etc. It needs a very extensive and polished technical guide....this is not it.
-  Secondly, neither the booklet included with the game OR the strategy guide, ever bother to tell you what the on-screen icons mean. Is that supposed to be half the fun? Figuring out what the Star means? They do fortunately have a ""text"" setting in the options of the game which switches these icons to text. But that is not mentioned anywhere either.
-  Third, the guide is far from complete. Contrary to the other reviewer, I say that it is an embarrassment that the developer published this guide and it is sooo incomplete. There is a weapons guide, but no Armor guide at all.
-  Additionally, the narrative of the book has a completely non-professional tone. It's like it was written by a 13 year old. There is so much extraneous information and unrelated commentary when describing a quest, its tough to find the real information. They start with a quest overview on 1 or 2 pages, then the following pages recite half of the information again that they told you in the overview... word for word! Its a waste of time and space that could have been used for things that should have been in the book....Like complete details on crafting and crystal types and strengthening, etc.  Also, if you are NOT performing quests in the same order they are presented in the book, it is hard to know where to look in the guide.
-  Many NPCs do not appear until certain parts of the game. Its kind of silly to develop an open world game where you have to do things in a certain order for it to work, that's the fault of the game. The fault of the guide is, only occasionally warning you when this will happen.
-  I honestly couldn't believe that the DEVELOPERS wrote a book with so little insight into the needs of the player.  This is a major reason why developers SHOULD farm out their guides to actual writers, because it seems they are too close to the product and more concerned with embellishing their perceived accomplishment than providing a guide.
-  The table of contents and the index are virtually useless. They don't include any references to the non-player characters, or specific items.  It seems almost like they were trying to look for fluff to fill this guide, but left out so much important stuff at the same time. It's sad really.
-  The maps, someone praised the maps? Really? in addition to having poor coloring tones and misplacing stones that you would use for reference points and just plain putting some of the sites in the wrong place...in addition to all of that, they don't even label the maps well with locations.  You start out chapter 1 in Bayan. There is not one comprehensive map that shows you your location within the whole scheme of the game. The main attempt to provide this, with a series of 3 maps around pg 99, is a failure.  They don't even label Bayan on the maps or any of the other towns, so you don't have much idea what you are looking at until you start tracking the locations in the map legend and realize some of them happen to be the same locations you saw plotted on the other 2 overview maps.
-  To its credit (and out of necessity) there are abundant postings online from the player community for this title. I spend much more time on the web ferreting out the info and armor guides that are useful and sometimes necessary, than I do going back to this book for info.
-  The Kingdoms of Amalur guide, despite page numbering faults, is a proper example of what this guide and game SHOULD have been. The 2 games are amazingly similar in technical features with Amalur being significantly more polished of the pair.
-  (As much as I have issues with Amalur), I would have to recommmend, anyone starting on adventuring should start with Amalur. Its the MUCH superior of these 2 implementations.  Amalur even rejected the clunky load/save ps3 engine and has its own...so you just hit the Save button, and go back to playing, while it saves in background...something ALL ps3 games should do IMHO.",Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

I was blown away and Ithought that the perfect Dragonball Z game was finally created. I was disappointed when Budokai Tenkaichi came out because it was just awful. When they finally made a good game they stepped back. When Burst Limit came out it appeared like it would be a next gen Budokai. It kinda is. A little background--when I was growing up there was a shopw called X play which reviewed video games. The Budokai series was always ranked low until Budokai 3 had come out. I figured with all of the high reviews and praise Atari would stick with the format. NO! NO! NO!

Budokai Tenkaichi and Raging Blast were awful, and this game is almost as bad. The gameplay is very much like Budokai but instad they wanted to make the game more cinematic. So you can now pick these little cutscene options which boost your power, but what sucks about it is that the cutscenes are distracting. Imagine you're getting stomped, but now you have a boost. You transform and you're laying the smack down. Right as you land a sweet combo and you go to follow up, suddenly a cutscene is triggered and you reset. I was playing this at tsome friends house and we all were laughing at how bad it was. To think this game is worth 100 bucks now. Who would pay 100 for this?! I bought it out of a bargain bin for 10 bucks and I still felt ripped off.

If they would remove the cutscenes, go back to Budokai 3's capsule system, and add the old mechanics this would be a good game. However, it's not. Avoid it. They recently released Budokai 3 for the 360, so get that instead. Also, if whoever is in charge of Atari is reading this--please remake Budokai 3. Infinite world was a good start.

2.0,False,"11 18, 2016",A2K7OP4VPIHQU9,B01FMQ3MGU,Chalgyr&#039;s Game Room,"One of my favorite non-sense games from the late-90's was Daytona USA for the Sega Saturn. While the Saturn was short-lived, it has some stellar games and out of the small pile that I had, Daytona USA was easily the most-played out of all of them. Fast forward 20 years and I am still a big racing fan, as evidenced by may various racing title reviews here (notably the Forza franchise), so when NASCAR Heat Evolution came across my desk I was thrilled. Here I was, hoping to get into a decent NASCAR title with arcade-style speed and simulator-style depth. Boy was I wrong; NASCAR Heat is best described as a half-measure across all facets of a racing game. The sad part is that there are a few decent features in NASCAR Heat Evolution, but the lack of attention and detail have yielded a relatively dull experience that leaves one reaching for more exciting titles.

NASCAR Heat Evolution is not a bad game, in fact, it could be a very GOOD game if the scope had been narrowed down from trying to be the ""everyman's racer"" to focusing on the more challenging simulator aspects of the game. Think Assetto Corsa, Gran Turismo 4, Forza Motorsports 5, but for stock-car racing with NASCAR's brand. Instead, with Heat, you have a strange mixture of laid-back ""lazy"" arcade racing game (with some horrible damage visuals) while trying to pose as a serious racing simulator. Some aspects, like race length, certainly ARE realistic and can take hours to complete, others, like the aforementioned damage models are ridiculously poor. Guess what happens if you decide to turn the wrong way down a track and drive into oncoming traffic. Damage is negligable, though the damage mentioned in the HUD will be freaking out with appropriately labeled damage, but the visual representation? Poor. I know, I know, I know, Forza does not have the greatest damage models, but at least glass breaks, fenders crumple, paint is scuffed in the Forza franchise; in NASCAR Heat Evolution it can happen, but it is about as far from realism as one can get.

In all fairness if you stick to the most challenging of difficulties in Heat Evolution, it can, and will utterly kick your butt. Racing because a challenge of the most miniscule of things, like positioning on a turn, or how well you are drafting someone (or they drafting you), and can be brutal and that is really where NASCAR Heat Evolution shines. A shame that it needs to be set to brutal difficulties and wear on your personal stamina based on some of the endurance runs, where you will be taking the same four turns for an hour at a time.

Some folks out there are complaining about lack of circuit diversity and while it is true, it can also be said that actual speedways for stock-car racing can be pretty darn boring; the excitement though, is not in the crazy turns, but rather the small calculated moves drivers make, the roar of the engines, the screeching of metals, the screaming of fans, and the flow of really (and I mean REALLY) bad beer. Unfortunately most of the traits that make NASCAR, or really any racing, are missing from Heat Evolution. Even the crowds are lackluster, lacking any real life, the skies are dull, interiors of your car are horrendoundous (though your hood does like quite nice, even after taking it 200 MPH into oncoming traffic), and there is no real sense of speed. On the bright side, controls are suitably snappy and do often provide realistic feedback based on speed, angle of approach, and whether your tires are fresh or not.

Take the audio; music is fine, the background tracks are suitably ""race-y"" and electrifying but when it comes to the rumble of the engine I cannot help be be reminded of the screaming gains and wicked throaty growl of a tricycle driven by a 4 year old with playing cards in the spokes. Where you would expect the bone-crunching, wince-inducing destruction of an engine biter destroying the heart of a Pinto, you get all the satisfaction of a cheap pillow fight between the worlds two laziest bulldogs. So many wasted opportunities in NASCAR Heat Evolution when it comes to the audio and it just breaks my heart. After a long stint of boring audio I often found myself listening to the life-given growl of a 2016 Camaro just to regain some of my lost composure. Sad as I am to say, NASCAR Heat Evolution is one to stay away from unless you are the most die-hardiest of NASCAR fans and are quite apologetic for its dismal online play, bizarre progression system (level up by unlocking tracks, and vice versa), and stale audio.",Do yourself a favor and pass on this one,1479427200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

Saga to me, however, doesn't really even qualify as a game, considering you do roughly half as much watching as you do playing, which is extrememly ridiculous. Believe me, I have patience, but when it comes to watching dozens of 30-45 minute cutscenes, you can count me out.
If Xenosaga is to get credit, it is for it's plotline. While it is interesting and thought provoking, it also doesn't bother to explain ANYTHING. Yes, this is Episode 1 of a 6 part series, but who cares; this is a game, it has a 50 dollar price tag, and I damn sure don't want to pay that much for a game that pretty much rips you off.
On one hand, the cutscenes are well made, almost on the lines of MGS2. On the other hand, the first half of the game features mostly extrememly tedious and boring cutscenes. It is only in the next half of the game where things get interesting, but a lot of people will stop forcing themselves to play by then. Yes I said 'forcing', because the gameplay is utterly BORINGG.
If theres one word that I would use to describe Saga's gameplay, its LINEARITY. Stick with me here: you watch a 45 minute cutscene, you run down a hall, take a few turns, fight some random battles, watch another cutscene, run down a hall, fight some battles, watch another cutscene, play through a long, tedious dungeon, watch another cutscene. You get the picture now? You see, the problem here is, the gameplay and story feel completely seperate. Its almost as if your watching an anime movie, except there are a few playable parts. The big problem is that the few playable parts are extrememly boring. Sure, the battle system isn't that bad by any means, but by the 20th battle, you'll be wondering why the hell your even playing.
And that's what I asked myself while playing the game: why the hell am I forcing myself to go on? Just so I can watch another 45 minute cutscene? From what I remember, games are suppost to be 'played', and are suppost to be 'fun'. Xenosaga is not an RPG. You want a 'real' rpg? Play Morrowind or Neverwinter Nights on multiplayer. Don't get me wrong here, Saga isn't a failure, it's just that the gameplay feels like a poor excuse to keep watching more cut scenes. I sure as hell am never going to play this game again. I am a huge Xenogears fanatic, and I really hope that Episode 2 doesn't turn out like this one. Xenosaga Ep1 is easily the biggest dissapointment for me in a long, long time, considering I have waited for this game for years.

I understand keeping ""Path of the Nijna"" as the title as it follows the same RPG-esqe combat and levelling system as its predecessor.  HOWEVER, it cannot be called a sequel to the original Path of the Ninja.

For those of you familiar with the series, this game doesn't pick up where the last one left off.  In fact, it skips somewhere between 30 and 40 episodes.  Tsunade is already Hokage, Sasuke has already left, and the Sand has returned to being allies of the Leaf.  The last game left off on Episode 80.  These conditions dictate a start somewhere around 120.

Not only that, but the story doesn't follow the series like the the first Path of the Ninja *AT ALL* but rather includes an entirely new storyline that is, how should I say?, predictable, basic, and overly-linear.  Plus, I beat story mode (the only mode I cared about) in just under 10 hours.  Pfft.

In summation: if you love Naruto (as I do), you will probably find this game enjoyable (especially since the price went down).

- Graphics: The art style and detail are solid, but this game can't maintain 30 FPS. Considering PS4's core selling point is it's graphics power, I think this is baffling.

I played through one story and I'm very much on the fence about playing again to see the rest of the story.

The production values aren't bad and the dialogue is ok but I had serious problems with the designs of the male interests. None of them are particularly aesthetically attractive or very masculine. I understand otome doesn't always have the most masculine love interests but these guys aren't cute compared to the characters in Hakuoki and Code: Realize.

The unattractive characters are made worse by their disgusting personalities. The main character is basically a wall without any actual opinions of her own and the male characters are all abusive and manipulative. You have the option of telling your love interest to shove it when he's being an ass but it leads to a worsening relationship and a bad ending.

Apparently the only way to get a good ending is to be submissive and agreeable no matter what and I wasn't interested in those choices. I would rather live with amnesia than put up with the condescending insults and outright abuse the love interest exhibited towards my character.

It sends a bad message to female players and male players alike. No woman should put up with that crap and there should be an option to break up with your love interest and reclaim your memories without having submit to any toxic masculinity.

I don't want to sound preachy or offended but it was hard to get lost in a romantic story when you're constantly questioning why your character would've fallen in love with such a jerk of a character in the first place.

Played Guitar Hero 1, 2 & Rock the 80's on Expert back in the day, and on those games when I'd miss notes I'd at least know WHY I'd miss the note, because of human error and I wouldn't flip out about it. In this game though, you will miss notes even though you 100% for sure know you nailed the note. It's frustrating on a level that makes Chinese Water Torture seem more appealing. Just to confirm that time hadn't taken hold, I went back and played the 3 original Guitar Hero games to see if maybe it's my skill that was the problem. Nope, I landed every single note that should have been landed, and every note I missed was due to me screwing up. Which is completely acceptable.

I have done some reading, and found that it took this company 3 attempts before figuring out what they were doing with calibration.

Background -
I purchased this game just a few days ago for the girlfriends birthday so we could have something to do together. I purchased Rock Band 2's big set because I had read that the Rock Band 1 instruments were of poor quality, but Rock Band 2's instruments were improved. I also feel that the Guitar that came with this was inferior in every way to the Guitar Hero games Guitar I'm sad to say. The groove on the yellow key at the center to let you know your at the center is replaced with little tiny dots that are elevated, which are rather annoying and don't give you that secure feeling that you know exactly where your hands are positioned at all times. Mind you Rock Band and Guitar Hero are made by the same company, so I'm just pointing out more of a frustration that could have easily been avoided had they stuck with a previous format rather then trying something new that wasn't for the better.

But, if anyone has played the previous Transformers game based on one of the movies, this is more of the same. Lazy, terrible graphics, poor controls, and a ridiculous difficulty spike in the second mission. Also, the voice acting is pretty bad, I continuously hear the enemies spouting the same phrases time and time again.

The gameplay just feels clunky. Between twitchy controls, awful land vehicle mode, and pretty dumb and ruthless AI.... this game pretty much lost all it had in its favor. I've gotten stuck on invisible barriers multiple times in the two hours I've played it. And getting hung up against a wall is very common as well.

The little bit of fun I was forcing myself to have with the game was immediately stripped away when I encountered these things. After 6 attempts, I'm done.

If you are on the fence, I know you've heard about the facial animations.  You MIGHT be able to get this fixed in a patch / mod later on - but there is a huge issue with the writing on this game in general.  It is jarring, and prevents you form becoming immersed in the game.  You ARE your character in this game, and choices for dialogue mean a lot.  You are pigeon holed into feeling certain ways about a conversation.

Some of the scenery was done very well.  But unfortunately, they seemed to have spent so much time making the game look good, they forgot to make actual play equally as exciting.
Regeneration starts off in the cabin in the woods. It was good to be back there and I was excited to see they brought the story line back to the creepy cabin. But just as you're getting into it, that level is quickly over. It was more like an intro. So you then find yourself in a mental institution that became possessed and over run with deadites. Perfect! what more could you ask for that a creepy hospital building? well, again, before you know it the level is over and you're out of there. Having not done much at all. The line of travel is mostly limited to one hallway. you never get to search out and find hidden areas and objects. No challenging puzzles or objects to find and later use someplace else like in ""Boomstick"". It's very simplistic and quickly over. what a let down. This seems to happen throughout the game. Although I will admit as the game went further on, it did improve slightly. But it just wasn't challenging. The game constantly tells you what to do and never lets you figure things out on your own. You walk near an elevator, the triangle icon appears on screen and tells you to push the button. Never letting you figure anything out on your own. There are so many cinematic cut scenes that you're constantly watching the game like a movie and waiting to actually play. There aren't as many interesting weapons to pick up as you go along either. Some of the execution cut scenes are cool when killing deadites, but over all, I was let down by the lack of challenge of this game. The Sam character ( voiced terribly by Ted Raimi ) is just horrible and makes game play annoying at times. Picture Scrappy Doo doing a Joe Pesci imitation. But so completely typical and over the top. Just not funny at all.  When you're controlling Sam in certain scenes, the music that comes on is just silly cartoonish music that doesn't fit with the scary theme of the game at all. Almost points out how stupid and unfitting the character is in this game.  I love the Evil Dead movies and enjoy Bruce Campbells character and voice over a lot. But believe it or not, the earlier, more simplistic looking ""Fistful Of Boomstick"" was much more enjoyable.

1) We do support the wireless controller. You need to use a micro-usb data cable. Kinda like requiring your cell phone to be hooked up to a wire, but still saying it's mobile.

2) Learn to read. We mentioned this in the user manual and the update page.  Er, yea. But I did not see the user manual until I purchased it, and there's no link to either on the product page.

2.0,False,"11 28, 2010",A386S7CE0QEJY4,B002BSA1C6,Red Baron,"This game took forever to come out and I have to say I am super disappointed,  this game could have and should have been much better then it is,  the plus sides of this game are that it's Gran Turismo,  even this lackluster game is decent,  I will play it a little bit longer and then switch back  to 4, or 3, on the ps2.  I have played every single one of these games,  I have to have them as soon as they come out I love the games,  but this one is so lack luster.  I can go through the things that have put me off from the game, and then finish up with a little closing.

1.  this game is TINY,  they may have 1'000's of cars but who cares if you only nine categories of races per challenge level,  and some only have one race.  Case in point, I think gt4 had 16 endurance races,  prologue for this game had four sections c,b,a, and s with 10 races per section I have not gotten all the way through but this game has around 20 races per section and 5 sections, so it has around 100 races for the gt mode, compared to the 110 races in gran turismo 4 witch was on the ps2, with much less disk space.  I thought that game was short, but this game took four times as long to come out, it should give more to the customers, then the prologue it gave us years ago.

2.  NO CARRY OVER,  part of the reason I eventually got the prologue was because it said that it would give a head start of gt5,  I spent a lot of time getting cars and money to transfer over to gt5 to save time later on, only to find out that the company changed their mind and took out this feature.

3.  B-spec is a joke this time around,  they tried to change it and made it stupid and worse then it was in GT4,  the drivers are stupid,  all the races are the same, so you get to watch an AI do a race you just mopped the floor with lose in slow motion,  I have great cars, and I cream the other cars, then I switch over to B-spec and watch my driver lose with the exact same car,  the leveling up is slow for the AI, driver, so you have to do the low level races a lot just to get the driver able to shift out of fourth gear,  I watched one of my drivers on a straight away and he never shifted out of fourth no matter what Command I gave him.  B-Spec drivers are super lame,  and it take to long to get them experience, and then when they have it, they still suck.

4.  I out the 8GB of information on my hard drive, and the load times are still very long for every race,  once the race is started however you can restart inside of the race as many times as you like, with out load times, so if you want to save time, restart if you feel bad about a race after the first or second lap.

5.  Physics is a bitch in this game, so often in the licenses and tests I would try and steer the car around a corner only to lose control,  If the point of the physics in this game is frustrate the hell of of players well then they are spot on.

6.  they added other cars to some of the challenges in the licenses section,  witch drives me crazy if a car hits you, you are disqualified,  and they hit you a lot.

7.  the license is different then in the last games,  I see no point to them any more,  you gain points through game play, that gives you levels, but as long as you drive a lot it does not seem like you need to pass the licenses,  I did not get much experience from passing the licenses, I have all of the except for the super which I am waiting to see if I need to get it in order to play the extreme races,  but it seems to be for casual games who may not be very good at the licensee portion of the game which was tougher in gt4.  This game should have changed it so you could choose how you want to advance through the game, licensee, points or what they had a combination of the two,  so that games could have control over how they play the game, instead of being shoe horned.

8.  Cars are good, but the races are centered around cars, I cold care less about, why have a raced centered around a little crap car I would never buy, it seems obvious that car companies got better treatment based on certain factors.

So, in conclusion, this is Gran Turismo 5,  we have been waiting a long time for it,  I think you might want to wait until it hits the greatest hits or drops in price, or pick up a used copy, because this game is going to have a lot of dlc,  I paid 30 bucks for this game, and feel like I overpaid for the amount and quality of the races,  Really disappointed in the lack of endurance races so far, you can not even look at what the future races are until you level up,  I have every licensee but the super, and I can not see the final group of races.  I am curious how gran turismo will justify new races to be downloaded after sticking people with a 60 dollar price tag for the game, as well as the lack of a bridge between, this game and the called prologue.

Edit: Have been playing the game more, and they have made some major screws loose,  I played forever to save up to get a f1 race car, and after I saved up 10,000,000.00 credits, and spent it all, it turns out that car can not be used in the regular races,  but their was no warning before I spent the credits, so a couple of days of saving up and selling other cars was a complete waste,  thats BS they should warn you,  also I can not even figure out where the race is for this car.

Interactive Entertainment, Wanted - Weapons of Fate is a 3rd person shooter directly following the events of the 2008 film.  In ""Wanted"" you play primarily as Wesley Gibson (sometimes you play as his father, Cross) a newly trained assassin of the Fraternity determined to track down the mysterious Immortal and uncover the hidden past of his family.  Here are my thoughts on Wanted - Weapons of Fate;

Pros

+ Decent graphics, especially character models.

+ Curving bullets is fun and never gets old.

+ Adult content

+ Adrenaline meter doesn't slowly deplete while not in combat or disappear when you get hit like in many games.

+ Some of the voice actors from the film such as Terence Stamp.

+ Crisp sound.

+ Solid controls.

+ Non-stop action.

Cons <Contains SPOILERS>

- No jumping, crouching or sprint options.  Everything is based on the cover system.

- Plenty of bad guitar angst rock combat music.

- Cut scenes look worse than the in game graphics, normally it's the other way around.

- Linear and repetitive gameplay.

- Overuse of profanity (mainly the F word) to point where it loses its impact.

- Enemies lack variety.  The knife fighters are especially redundant and tiresome.

- Bosses were all too similar and easy to kill, especially the final boss.

- The ending, wow.  One of the worst and most ridiculous I've ever seen in a game.

Wanted - Weapons of Fate is perfect example of a movie/comic license translated into another mediocre game experience.  Repetitious enemies, levels and snarky one-liners this game has a rather limited demographic.  I can perhaps see a younger audience finding the game amusing but it failed to appeal to me.

This is just WoW with a few skin changes and some names taken out of a couple of Tolkein books.

To be fair, they did expand it a bit. Now as you grind pointlessly through kill and gather quests that have absolutely nothing to do with the story, you can earn ""Deeds"" and ""Titles"" to show off or improve your character's abilities. But, otherwise, everything about this game feels exactly like WoW, from the character control right on up to the gameplay itself.

If you like WoW and you just want a change of scenery and a new story, go ahead and give it a shot. If you didn't like WoW, you might want to hold off and see how it holds together at higher levels. WoW wore out its welcome for me when my grind got me into Desolace at about level 44. Whether this game will sputter and fall falt on its face as well remains to be seen.

One final point: you might want to hold off briefly either way. While the whole thing is clearly nothing more than a direct copy of World of Warcraft, it's not nearly as polished yet.

2.0,False,"10 4, 2016",A1BB4H9G9APMT3,B01GU89H6I,Da Jester,"3 years ago, I posted two reviews involving Destiny and its, at the time, upcoming content for year one. As you guessed, I was extremely negative about both. Yes, Expansions 1 and 2 were not released at the time of my review posting. However, still to this day, I will remain tenacious of my reasoning regardless of how many people down-voted those reviews. And for the most part, I feel my opinions were justifiable about the absolutely asinine treatment from Bungie and Activision with their new IP. With the latest and final expansion for Destiny, nothing really has changed in that department.

Which is an absolute shame since how much The Taken King expansion fixed SO MUCH of what was wrong with Destiny year one. The Rise of Iron expansion is a far cry of what the previous supplied in content. For $30 or $29.99, expect very a short winded story along with a very underwhelming new patrol area, the Plaguelands. I'm not exactly sure how long it took me to complete the initial story grind, but it felt mostly near just one movie's length. It literally ends with an exciting ""boss like"" encounter that even made cynical me say ""wow"" out loud. But as soon as it was over and the last cutscene played, I literally sighed and said ""I don't know what I expected."" From there on players are back doing literally the exact same activities they have been doing since year one. Now, me as a World of Warcraft player, I'm used to grind for better loot to raise a certain stat type of gameplay. However, in WoW, I have gigantic varying areas and a plethora of activities (PVP and PVE) to do so. Rise of Iron's new locales will get old fast just like how house of Wolves and the Dark Below did. Even if you were hoping more missision will pop up like how TTK did (always enjoyed more from Cayde-6), don't expect maybe 2 more at most. Then it's ""oh! well, gotta do strikes now!"" Some parts are pretty neat looking and the Archon public area will stand out the first time. But still, it will be the same areas over and over for patrols and strikes. Speaking of, there are 3 new strikes, but 2 are just reskins for the SIVA Crisis...which were exciting to play once again (even with the awesome boss music), but are immediately nothing special the second time you do them. For an ""expansion,"" nothing really is expanded on. No new original features added or quality of life changes.

From what I read on reddit and seen on youtube, the only way to really enjoy Destiny is if you do PVP and the Wrath of the Machine raid. Bungie goes all out for this content area, and I'll admit, rightfully so. But, I just wished they put that much pizzazz into the story content and even the strikes...or new strikes since many people will be grinding those to even get near the light level requirements for endgame. So honestly, no. I cannot suggest buying Rise of Iron for it's asking price. For $19.99, it would be almost justifiable. Bungie did state that RoI was going to be short...but for $29.99, I really wasn't expecting it to be this short and underwhelming. If you are absolutely new Destiny, then I strongly suggest you buy the complete edition...which essentially makes Destiny finally seem like a complete release instead of the hollow pay for more substance later version that so many of us had to contend with.

I'm sure Destiny enthusiasts will tell you its absolutely worth it's price with the hours they've pumped into it. For the most part, they will bring up really good points for their reasoning. However, after I completed the story the performed various activities for the Taken King (year two), Destiny has literally only one function for me personally: a boring game to play while I rock my son to sleep at night. And it still continues today especially with Rise of Iron. No, I have not done Wrath of the Machine yet. I would love to, but I cannot stand Bungie's approach to zero in game matchmaking and social communication for raid and Nightfall strike forming. Hell, I would love to do old raids and experience what I missed out on! But you have to use outside sources to find people who want to do them with you. It was archaic for a console based shooter released in 2014, and it still stand in 2016!

Final thoughts since this is the end for Destiny 1: Bungie has no choice but to make the announced Destiny 2 near the quality of Diablo II, or even Borderlands 2. Remember, it was reported that $500 million was used to make Destiny and I assume it's 10 year franchise plan. Well, I've seen and played games that were built and still hold up with a fraction of that amount. In fact I'm still playing one today! I don't mind paying for more content for a game as long as the core experience was good or great enough to begin with.

2.0,False,"02 19, 2004",AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B00006JZQZ,Michigoon,"Splinter Cell is one of those games I wish I could finish. The graphics are so beautiful that my friends and I have spent hours just playing the lighting engine, the way curtains flow, the way you can interact with objects... that much is masterful. The gameplay, however, can often be the opposite. There are a lot of reviews, and a lot of ground to cover, so I'm only going to address some key points here. My first draft of this review was also way too long. Trust me, this is the bare bones details of my review.
My beef starts with Sam's weaponry. Sam's standard pistol is the most useless pistol I have ever encountered in a game, especially because it's this game. In most conditions, the pistol is so wildly inaccurate that by the time you've moved into killing range you might as well just make the effort to go for hand-to-hand combat. Other times, for no apparent reason, you can take down a dozen guards with as many shots. However, the game tends toward the former most of the time. This is critically saddening because it ruins so many moments. For example, the game's lighting engine means shooting out a lamp will darken the room. To get the jump on some enemies, shoot out the light and when they come to investigate you'll have the upper hand (night/thermo vision... engage). But have fun trying to shoot that light. Your wildly inaccurate pistol and quirky game physics mean it might take you anywhere from one shot to a dozen and agonizing moments of aligning your crosshair until you manage to take out the lamp. My personal record is wasting just under 2 clips before a ceiling light FINALLY blew out. Keep in mind, it only takes one hit to shatter any glass in the game. His other ""tools"" would require some spoilers to cover and are thus omitted. Mostly, the other weapons and gadgets are excellent.
Adding to that, the game revolves around a Metal Gear Solid style alert system which ranges from brilliant to unforgivable. Sometimes, saving yourself from game over is a matter of being quick and making sure guards don't make it to alarms if they notice you. Other times, it's walking around a corner only to not notice the camera setting in the dark until you hear a blaring alarm and ""Game Over"". Restart, be more careful, lean around the corner to spy on the action... oops, you caught the camera when it was looking in your direction. Game over. Retry, sneak up, whip out your pistol, lean around the corner, camera's facing away... okay now shoot. Miss. Again. Again. Three more. The rest of the clip. Oh joy, Game Over again.
And therein lies the big problem for me- having to restart so much. At times, you'll breeze through whole sections of levels with smooth spy precision as though it was second nature. But unless you're very lucky, 90% of your gameplay time will be retrying the same hallway over and over and over because of any number of problems. The game relies on a ""checkpoint"" system where you only get to save when you accomplish certain goals. This means, unfortunately, you may spend ten minutes stealthily clearing one section only to open the wrong door at the wrong time and get Game Over before your save. Sorry, Charlie, do it all over again.
When you're ""in the groove"" with this game, it's sheer heaven. The technology is fascinating, the story is enveloping, and using your array of moves and tools is a blast. However, even for a gamer as patient as I am, you're going to need serious dedication to finish this game. As it stands, this game was utterly unplayable for me past the first few levels- one of which took on the order of a full day filled with cursing and various ill-natured gestures toward my television to complete. And in the end, I will only ever touch this game to play around with the gorgeous graphics and gizmos.","Technologically masterful, technically overrated.",1077148800,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},
2.0,False,"10 11, 2008",AWAGSXM9CNZCC,B000FRU1UM,An Android Fan,"There's no need to discuss the hype behind this game or its commercial success. We all know it was well received by the public, got great reviews and made Rockstar even richer.

So how does it play? Was it worth the wait? Should it have waited even longer? Maybe and absolutely.

The game does an admirable job of representing what is basically New York and having a sympathetic lead who kills, steals and double-crosses to survive. He doesn't like what he does, wishes he didn't have to do it, but in order to fulfill his objective, he has to do these things. (Note that the vast majority of people he kills, steals from and double-crosses aren't even worthy of being called scum.) The game also forces the player to make some hard choices which have long-lasting consequences. And of course, true to form for a GTA game, there's weapons, explosions, sex, car chases, gun fights and profanities aplenty.

Which leads me to the first of many letdowns for this game. The missions are so repetitive, so tedious, so monotonous, and so boring that it is literally impossible to truly differentiate one mission from the next. A good 50% of the game, probably more involves shooting endless waves of enemies, many of whom pop up in completely illogical places. It is very easy for one enemy to kill you in a matter of seconds after having done so well up to that point.

Which brings me to my next point: Mission failures. The system Rockstar put in place is by far the worst system in any AAA video game, and budget titles would do well to stay far from this as well. If you fail a mission, you must restart the mission entirely. From the beginning. Every single time. It doesn't matter if the mission is a single chase, a single shootout or if there is more than one part to it. (The final mission has five parts to it.) If something goes wrong, you start back at the beginning and you have to redo the entire thing all over again. There are no mid-mission checkpoints. This is completely inexcusable.  Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, so video games have had checkpoints in them for at least seven years now and probably longer than that. Please don't put in a comment about how I forgot about how X game had them in 199X. I am not interested, I am only using that particular game as an example. That's it. End of discussion.

And yet, when you do restart, you still lose EVERYTHING you used in the mission. Why is that? Why should I have to replenish everything I lost on something that didn't actually happen? I can't think of any game that does this, and I probably wouldn't want to play such a game, mainly because I prefer games that are fun. Is having to restock ammo and armor on a mission that didn't actually just happen fun? No. That's downtime, and downtime isn't fun, especially when it's needless downtime. And Rockstar isn't based in someone's garage. This is a very large company with a huge budget, so these amateurish design decisions are even more inexcusable.

Speaking of inexcusable design decisions that were antiquated long, long ago, let's discuss another aspect of gun fights. For some reason, when Niko is being shot at, his default speed, running or walking is the exact same speed as when nothing is going on. SWAT 3 came out almost NINE YEARS AGO, and that game had a dynamic speed change. In other words, if shots were fired, everyone sped up. Not Niko. No, he'll just wander around unless you actually hit the run button. Which also makes him run just as fast as though nothing is going on. Wouldn't someone who is trying to find cover so they don't get shot move faster than if they aren't in danger? If you'd like a more recent example of what Rockstar should have done, take a look at Mass Effect.

The driving mechanics also have a much higher learning curve than what it needs to be, especially with motorcycles and helicopters. Why Rockstar didn't take more time honing the controls and making them easier to pick up is anyone's guess. Same with ladders. I have a friend who will tap the Y button until his thumb is ready to break and even still Niko will not climb the ladder that is right in front of him. This is usually after swimming a ridiculous distance to it since the game doesn't allow the player to just suicide and spawn at the nearest hospital. No instead we have to swim ridiculously long distances. Talk about fun huh?

Which is about the same as can be said for multiplayer. You just walk or drive around the city. There is nothing to do. Nothing. No activities, no places to go, nothing. There are some missions that can be done but if you just want to free roam with a friend in multiplayer, that's ALL you get to do. A drop-in, drop-out co-op in the story mode would've been much, much better.

Oh, yeah, the story. Well what little there is isn't too bad, when the game actually allows you to see it. Most of the time it's too busy bogging you down with those same repetitive missions I talked about earlier where it always goes the exact same way - a deal that shouldn't have any problems where Niko is just there ""as insurance"" turns into a battle ground with lots and lots of enemies, then just they're all dead, more spawn in the area that was just cleared, then the fight leads to a car/motorcycle chase which leads to a police chase, lather, rinse, repeat. Almost all of the missions have this exact same format. The only things that change are the goons' clothing and the SET of lines Niko yells out as he kills them (not the actual lines themselves.) So don't worry kids, if you heard him say something in a mission, he will say it again! And again....and again....and again.

And lastly, for some reason even though games have been doing this for years, GTA IV still allows objects that obstruct your view of the player to remain opaque. Every other high quality title I have ever seen that operates in 3rd person forces such obstructions to go transparent.

The characters Niko takes missions from and/or befriends are your stock cardboard cutouts but let's face it, no one plays a GTA game for the character study. That's why we have those....um....what're those things called, libraries have them....oh well. Anyway, the dialogue is at times rather humorous, especially when Niko is hanging around Brucie. I think we've all known a Brucie at some point in our lives, so to see Niko indirectly poke fun at these guys is a treat. And as usual, GTA IV satirizes many aspects of society and pop-culture that are just begging for it. Celebrities, radio-talk show hosts, gossip magazines, plenty of entertainment venues and the masses that support them all get the healthy shot of parody that has been coming to them for years.

With a whole lot more polish, mid-mission checkpoints and far less repetition, GTA IV would deserve the accolades and commercial success it has enjoyed as of late. As it stands, however, it is yet another proof that hype, a big name label and commercial success do not always mean a great game.

You are a potential client of many corporations.  Electronic Arts lets you know this from the very first time you pop in the ProStreet disc.  Yes, there will be pandering.  Of course there's stereotyping of the ""import culture"".  It's got everything you expect in a modern NFS game from an annoying announcer that won't shut up to a music selection consisting of only current pop songs.  It's obvious that the game was developed by a committee of suits who are using it simply as a mechanism of further sales.

I suppose there's an in-ad game in here as well.  I'm not sure what EA was attempting to do in the game when it comes to car control and physics.  It seems like the developers played a game with decent physics like Forza 2 and then emulated it in the worst possible way.  There's a poor mash-up  of arcade and simulation physics in here and the result is an unsatisfying ""feel"" when driving.  FWD cars will oversteer when you increase the throttle after turning off all the assists (to do so requires a trip down a few menus).  Light to moderate braking doesn't lighten the tail of the vehicle as expected.  Unfortunately, your choices for control range between simple button mashing and an uncontrollable mess.

Some of the race modes are unfairly designed (such as Sector Shootout).  This is because whoever sets the fastest time on a particular section of the track gets all the points for that section.  The problem is that you will always start at the pack of the pack and thus the lead AI vehicle will consume most of the points on the first run around the track.  There are times when you will compete against vehicles significantly better or worse than your own car which makes the game feel cheap all around.

There's a nice selection of cars but winning races doesn't earn you much money and thus you won't be able to afford them using in-game currency.  Which brings up another issue: Micro-transactions in-game.  When your car is damaged you can spend real money to repair it.  If you want a new car or more modifications you can buy it using real money.  I believe it's fairly obvious why EA made it hard to earn in-game money.  They want you to reach into your pocket and pull out a little bit more green.  Apparently, shelling out the money for a video game up front isn't enough as now we are expected to pay to enjoy the game as well.

This is the first Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG),  to be on any home console and I have to say it is one of the worst out there. As with any other MMORPG you create an account and pay your monthly fee. Next you create a character and log into the huge massive world. Perhaps the massive world is the only thing I liked about this game, as it was always a pure joy to just walk around and seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldy go where no other Everquest nerd has gone before! Honestly though I did find it fun and enjoyable to walk around the world. Anway, once you make your character you do missions or ""quests"" in which you complete tasks and are awarded Experience Points (XP). XP points get your character levles. Once each new level is obtained, it takes more XP to get to the next one. The advantage of getting to a higher level is that you can: 1. Wear new armor, get new weapons, kill bigger animals, and do new and repetitive quests. The max level you can obtain is 50, and to give you an idea of how long this will take to obtain Sony says the following: 500-600 hours! WOW! I can tell you for a fact that it will take around 1,000 hours for most people. In order to get that valuable XP you have to kill animals and fantasy monsters. You do so by endlessly typing into your USB Keyboard (NEEDED ITEM!) asking for a group. Once in your group, you walk to an area to kill go kill these monsters. You kill monsters by pressing the X button. Each monster takes about 20 button presses. It takes about 500 kills to level up. To most sane people this is just too much. To top it off, if you cannot find a group, you cannot kill these animals and so the game becomes usless if there isn't anyone else playing. This game becomes very, very, very, stressful in the later levels, which is why I canceled my account just days ago. As icing on the cake, the game graphics are very poor.

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations, which part of it is because it wasn't the same people (believe it or not) that did Symphony of the Night (PSX).  Read on to see why it's a below average game:
THE GOOD
Finally, Castlevania in 3-D!  Despite many shortcomings, the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere, which are characteristic of a Castlevania game (at least the newer releases).  You can select between two characters (Carrie and Reinhart) that change the storyline somewhat.
THE BAD
I was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most.  The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it.  Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game.  Also, the storyline, aside from the two characters' different (yet similar) paths, is really hollow at its core and doesn't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.
OVERALL
Not recommended.  I advise renting the game only.  ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend skipping it.  I'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice.  I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines (Genesis); Why?!  Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this!

2.0,True,"08 17, 2011",A15VWJF3E3ECJL,B003UFAZZW,Zas,"Let me start by saying the game started out a little rough around the edges. I played the demo a few months before I officially bought the game and was pretty excited. After deleting the demo and starting the game, I realized that I could have just kept the demo done and saved some time. However, the refresher was nice. The story line jumped around a little bit trying to mimic the style of flashback films where it started telling a story and you would play through it. However, I spent a full 14 hours on Act 1 upgrading, completing every single quest I could. The cut scenes were beautiful and the newly remodeled combat system took a few fights to get used to but overall I approve. The graphics are considerably better than the original Dragon Age Origins and the frame-rate provides a very pleasing to the eyes transition when rotating and running around (which is done by pressing X if you've forgotten).
My first run-in with frustration was the fact that if you don't pick up all the gold off the ground right after a fight, sometimes it would immediately innitiate a cutscene and transport you out of the area in to which you can never return and you lose that gold forever. This coincides with frustration point #3.
My second run-in with frustration was a game freeze or two. Not a problem. Everyone knows these massive RPG's are going to be a little hard on your system. They can't have giant worlds to explore without making some frusterating areas that look like you can explore them but can't, and be without glitch.
My second frustration caused me 2-4 hours of my life I really want back! After mid-way through the quest ""Fools Rush In"" with Isabela. For those who don't know, if you click on the body to quick, it will create a bug that doesn't let you in the Chantry to complete the quest. Later I found out this was called 'A game breaking bug'. I spent 10-20 minutes going around the Chantry clicking X like a maniac, doing reloads, switching characters, switching users, playing with the menu, etc.. until I finally skipped the quest. After coming back with only 35 gold pieces, I realized I needed 15 more to finish up Act 1. I back to try the Chantry again with no luck. I went online only to find out that BioWare had admittedly known about this bug for FIVE MONTHS already and decided not to patch it yet. Any coder that could real any forms would know the bug lies within that corpse and a line of story logic that is being interruppted.
This indeed was a game breaking bug because I was not about to repeat 10-15 hours on just Act 1 to finish the game. It took me 15 the first time and would probably take 10 the next. I did become really accustomed to the layout after exploring every inch of the map for an additional 10 gold pieces but could not find them. This is my conclusion:
BioWare made a good game that they weren't sure if people were going to take to the changes. Hypothethically (and this is just a no-pointing fingers theory) if they were smart, they would encode some sort of glitch in there to make more money. So what if there was a glitch in there- not for everyone because some people would just restart 10-15 hours in (the people who replay FF games 10 times). This glitch is for the impulsive people who go around clicking before cutscenes in order to make sure they get the items off the ground before they disappear forever (because you're already short on cash). The same impulsive people who wouldn't mind dropping $4-$10 on some DLC in order to just say ""ah, can't wait for a patch!! Let's just finish the game.""
I'm not restarting the game. I'm going to boycott and wait for a patch! I'd rather spend my time writing an honest, highly oppiniated review about the game than waste 10-15 hours of my life restarting this over again.
I will say there is high replay value in the game as I belive if I ever finish (pending BioWare's speedy patch-work... I mean it has been 5 months already) that I can conclude my hypothesis was right and there are oodle's of options in changing your character's decisions and drastically affecting outcomes a lot more than the original Dragon Age.

There is lag in this game that makes it almost unplayable...scratch that, unwinnable.

As of December 5, 2011, there is a feature in this game that was meant to make it playable by those with excellent connections along with those with bad connections. It is being called lag compensation by many who have reviewed it.

But this lag compensation is ruining the play of many who have excellent connections.

It is unintentionally causing the player with the fastest connection to lag, allowing players with bad connections to land shots faster and, in some situations, to actually shoot the faster connected players around corners.

On the one hand, the game is great fun. Most well made ARPGs are. However, most of this game is plagued with problems.

For one, the Always Online DRM. First off, this piece of software made it nearly impossible to get online within the first few days, as many know already. The infamous Error 37. However, if you read the EULA, there is a clause in there that says this game can be played both online and off.

""11. Duration of the ""On-line"" Component. - The Game is capable of both offline and online player modes, both of which require that you obtain authorized access to the Service."" Knowing that, why is there no Offline Option? Oh, because we'd be playing it wrong, according Jay Wilson, the Game Director. Yeah, thanks pal. Telling the buyers how they should be playing the game they purchased and which is no longer yours. That makes sense.

Next, we have the latency problems. Because the loot and other aspects of the game are rendered and calculated through the servers and not in-game, sometimes you'll get items dropped a second late. Or your character could try and run from a mob of enemies, only to have the server hiccup; by the time the server starts working, your health is mostly gone. And then, my favorite: Having the game kick you out because your connection died/the server malfunctioned/the power went out/ect. ect.

This is a Single Player capable game, and a fast, twitch based one at that. Why all these latency problems, much less calculations that are handled on some remote server instead of in-game? I could hardly care about what modders do to their games. Just let me play mine how I wish, and offline if I wish. After all, I paid 108.65 for this thing.

-------------------------------------

Now, on the subject of streamlining, I look at this the same way I did for Skyrim: I detest streamlining when it is done in such a way that depth is removed. In Diablo III, you cannot pick and choose your skills. They all unlock for you. If you look at Titan's Quest, Torchlight, or any other ARPG, you'll see that you can make a conscience choice to overlevel certain skills with points, or save them for later.

In Diablo III, because every skill becomes unlocked, this no longer applies. Even with runes, which grant only one change to the skill, you can't overlevel any skills. What if I want to level Hungering Arrow up instead of one of my Discipline skills? You longer have those kinds of choices. While this does make the game easier to play, you lose a lot of depth in building your character the way you want. You're essentially waiting for the game to give you permission, and once it does, it's feels like you're held back.

As for the loot... This doesn't really need explaining. Weapons you find are incrimental increases between each other more than in the past. This leaves you with piles of junk which are barely any different from each other, and worth far less gold overall. Thus, the act of going back to town and selling just got more tedious, and early on, frustrating without the Town Portal ability. Since the loot is generated from an off-site server, I blame that for this.

My DS was permanently marked by the extra DS stylus (secured in its designed place in this product) while inside this case.  Fortunately I noticed it in time and could rub out the mark so it's hardly noticeable.

Here's the whole story.  I read on other buyers' reviews on Amazon that their DSes were being scratched by the extra DS games they kept inside this case.  Apparently there isn't enough space between the extra game pockets and the DS itself so that any extra games in the case rub against each other when this case is closed, causing abrasion and scratching on the DS.  I only wanted this case for my DS, not the extra game pockets, and had heard nothing about similar problems with the extra stylus.  So I tried it out with the extra stylus in its pocket in the case.  I noticed abrasion marks in the shape and area of the extra stylus within a week and promptly removed it.  The case works fine with no scratching without games or extra stylus in the pockets.  So be prepared to not use any of the pockets for games and the extra stylus in this case unless you don't mind scratching your DS!

However, if you don't use the game and stylus pockets in the case OR don't mind scratching your DS, then this case is pretty nice.  The good part about this case is that it is very hard and thick, making it very durable.  This could protect your DS from a heavy falling object.  One drawback of this durability is that it weighs so much!  It feels like it weighs about as much as the DS itself.  This could be troublesome for children.  One other small benefit is that it has a hole to insert a strap to carry the case from, the case itself however does not come with such a strap.  One drawback to this is that the hole is a liability to the DS inside, making it vulnerable to possible spilled liquids because of it's position close to the bottom of the case.",Could damage your DS!!!,1247961600,2,{'Color:': ' White'},

And too,the return of the dreaded random battle system,the addictive(duh...)card game from FFVIII which promises no rewards but..satisfaction(woohhoo..rare cards! But i can't turn them into rare materials!!).And to compare this to FF VII is absolute ...,even ... First of all,the mini-games are,very,very little compared to FF VII.You don't even have FF IX's own Gold Saucer,and the mini-games are just the card game,the chocobo ""hot and cold""(go digging like a ... to upgrade your chocobo and get rare items),and a numb mini-game which involves the big,fat Quina catching frogs hopping around the marshes. What about the gameplay,it's a drab too. You have your typical stereotype Zidane dominating the game and even characters like Vivi,Dagger(what a...dumb name the so hyped translators give)and Eiko,with powerful spells and summons,is deemed useless. Unlike previous Final Fantasies,each character have it's own specific abilities. You have Zidane hacking around with his sword,and absolutely useless in magic(except his trances),Vivi,the good-for-nothing little wizard whose magic skills are incomparable to Zidane's strength(until very,very later in the game),Dagger a.k.a Princess Garnet,with powerful summons(which are useless when you go hop into the last dungeon),Quina a user of blue magic who eats his enemies to learn spells(only a portion of his spells worked).While these characters are like you typical Walt Disney characters or Ben Hur type casts(sarcasm),again compared to Zidane,like extras instead of support characters. And compared to even Square's ""flop"" FF VIII has more balanced cast of characters.
If you think random battle is bearable,like FF VII and FF VIII,this is the most frustrating game after FF VI(for PSX)to date,and prepare for countless hours of head banging moments. There is no moogle charm(FF VI) or Diablos's Enc None (FF VIII)to ease or diminish random encounters. Worse,every battle is just tiresome,with slow loading times and slow ATB bar. This problem even effects your haste spell,where there is no difference in enemy's frequent attacks even when you cast it.
Finally,this ""light hearted"" Final Fantasy is just not really funny. There is a handful of situations that will only gives you a mere sneer in you face.

This is offset by the horrible linearity of the game, which destroys suspension of disbelief and the ability to lose myself in the story.

If I want linearity, I can read a novel. Video games are supposed to offer choices - that is why people play them. A video game should not herd you from location to location, but Jericho does. I found the feature where you switch between characters fun for about two minutes, and then it became irritating as I was herded into doing so multiple times. Again - the game was making the choices instead of me. That's bad design, in my opinion.

Finally, I was extremely disgusted to see the reemergence of a horrible programming technique from the SuperNintendo days - being forced to play little games where you tap a series of buttons and die over and over in a loop until you get them right. For instance, a corpse suddenly rises out of the ground and grabs you. Tap A to punch it in the face. Now Tap B to push it away. Tap Y to kick it in the crotch. Quick! Tap B again to smash its head with your hammer. You get the idea. Boring.

Bottom line - I cannot stomach being herded from point to point despite the interesting storyline. I'll never finish this game.

The game has great graphics, awesome sound, the atmosphere is definetively Silent Hill.  I got hooked by the graphics and could not get enough of the storyline.  So what went wrong?  Well, it is the terrible control scheme which makes the game more difficult that it should be.  While the weapons (guns) worked just fine, there was little ammo for them.  That left me with melee weapons like a knife.  Alex (the main character) is very slow with his melee weapons.  By the time you swing you weapon (quick swing or the slower more powerful swing), the enemy will be right on top of you doing a lot of damage to your health.  And the health drains like there is no tommorrow.  I know that there are players out there who figured out the ""dodge"" system.  It hardly worked for me.  For every one single succesful dodge, I probably failed an average of seven dodges.  It just doesn't work.  So you would think that the developer would include the ""easy"" option for the players that just can't cut it in the game.  You'd be wrong.  I mean, I really enjoyed the game atmosphere and the storline and would have liked to see the game through, but no easy option was available for me.  Don't get me wrong I play games on normal difficulty, but if I am having a heck of a time in the game, I like switching over to the easy option.  The other issue is the save option.  I found myself several times looking for a save spot running low on health and ammo, with no save point to be found.  I played litterally over 30 to 40 minutes at a time before finding the next save point.  About half way through the game, I came upon one of the bosses with no extra health left and only 3 shells in my shotgun.  After being defeated numerous times, I finally gave up.  Frustrated with the game, I put the game up for sale.  Let someone else be frustrated with it.  Since I do like the Silent Hill games, I will probably end up buying Silent Hill Downpour.

Normal people don't write ten pages of awesome reviews and hail how great anything is like most of  the huge in depth reviews that are for this game.  It's just not normal.

The second thing that is slightly related to the first is that this game's graphics totally suck!  We are just shy of the year 2013 yet the graphics on this game resemble those from about five or six years ago, the cinematics are horrible.  There are so many rips and tears in the graphics along with horrible, unnatural movements from the other characters that it's almost too hard to watch and play.

PROS:
- Contours to the hand (at least my own) perfectly. Easy to grip, no ""clawing.""
- Amazing feeling surface (though, after extended use, it's ""sandpaper"" feeling would likely go away)
- Buttons are nicely contoured for the thumb (7, 8, and 9 for instance point out (not unlike blackberry keys) at the back while 1, 2, and 3 point forward--10, 11, and 12 are relatively flat for use with the bottom-side of the thumb's knuckle).
- Left and Right scrollwheel tilt is a nice feature that doesn't seem to be very popular.
- Software works well.

CONS:
- It simply doesn't work at points, which is not okay at any point for a gaming mouse. I had the dock (also the wireless transceiver) less than 2 feet from the mouse at all times and the mouse would still end up with choppy connections or the occasional complete drop-out of movement (the buttons, however, would continue to function). One would assume that plugging it directly into the PC (which is just a micro-USB cord that the dock also uses) would alleviate these problems. Not at all. Not at all.
- The battery life is abysmal. The battery is built in. Both of these things should not be true at one time. Either get the battery life to work for greater than 12 hours (honestly, it may not even be that long), make it AA-compatible so we can buy our own rechargeable AAs and game wirelessly for longer, or stop making a wireless variant that costs $30+ more for (I'm truly hoping) worse performance than your wired variant.
- No onboard memory -- Like other Razer products, you can't take profiles with you. You are 100% dependent on their software and the OSes it is developed for (It will work on Linux, but you will only have the numbers mapped to your thumbkeys and the lighting only on Specrum mode...aka ""Demo mode"" or default OOBE only).

There's nothing more I can say because like all FPSs it's the same thing all over again just in a different time and different place. However, it was a fun FPS game that I enjoyed; but then again who wouldn't love going around shooting people in a game? It really gets your frustrations out. So all in all the game was good. The problem I have with it (which therefore is causing me to sit on the fence) is that it was SO short. Honestly, I'm not the kind of gamer that likes to beat games quickly (I like to play a little of one game, and a little of another and so on and so forth simply because I like making my games last) but yet somehow I finished it in one day. The amount of time I spent on it was the exact same as any other game I have played (Bioshock, Call of Duty, Borderlands) but instead of doing around 25% of the game- it was finished. I was so disappointed when I realized I had finished it, because honestly I really liked the game. Another example of a game that was also sadly too short was Halo 3. I'm sure many of you have played Halo 3 and I'm also pretty sure that you also thought the game was too short. If that is true then I don't suggest buying this game. If you want a game that you can explore, do things how you want to and get hours of game play out of it, I suggest something like: Skyrim, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Dishonored.. those are all amazing games that are far from short and have endless things to do. With that said, another great game like this is Red Dead Redemption.
So basically what I'm saying is that if you REALLY like FPSs and don't care how long it is as long as you can shoot people then sure get the game it was fun. If you don't mind getting a game that has some shooting but is longer and has more map space then get one of the games I suggested.

2.0,False,"11 16, 2010",ATR72FW8LEZV1,B002I0I85Y,C. L. Hanson,"I bought Flingsmash based on Nintendo's usually reliable track record of providing fun games with their first party controllers and periphials (Wii Sports Resort, Mario Kart Wii), with my decision also influenced by a July E3 preview on IGN.com where this game was called ""Span Smasher"" and sounded like the sleeper hit of the year. The fact that it came with the new Remote Plus made it also appear to be a great value.

That being said...if you gamble, sooner or later, you'll lose. Nintendo took a gamble that Artoon (developer of Yoshi's Island DS) could make a game to showcase the Remote Plus' abilities. I took a gamble that the game would be the hit that IGN said it would be. We both lost. Flingsmash simply does not work as intended, and could very well be the most disappointing purchase I've made for the Wii yet. The fact that Nintendo packaged this turd with it's Remote Plus makes me disappointed with them for not pushing themselves and Artoon harder to create a better gaming experience.

The premise is simple: you use the Remote Plus to smack the ""hero"" into boulders, prizes and enemies across a pre-determined course, trying to keep the character moving, as a 3 headed ""Hydracoil"" (dragon) is behind you. Collect 3 special coins scattered about the board, which transform into a pearl when you reach the end. Collect enough pearls and you face the ""Boss"" at the end of each stage and advance. As you progress, new action items appear such as cannons, spinners, tunnels...etc, and while it all sounds like a great amount of fun, it should be noted that the character seldom goes exactly where you want to smack him. This is not because I am ""holding the controller wrong"", or based on skill. I've played my fair share of Wii Sports tennis and other games where you hit objects and they go where intended.

As if graphics matter at this point, they are OK, showing a style reminiscent from Artoon's Yoshi's Island DS. The music and sound effects are by and large forgettable. The storyline is just there to give the character/game a purpose. Nintendo has made plenty of games with outside developers since the NES days, with silly storylines but solid gameplay. A good example was RARE's ""Cobra Triangle"". The most bizarre storyline ever, but a fun game. The only difference between ""Cobra Triangle"" and Flingsmash is that ""Cobra Triangle"" was fun.

If you need a new Remote Plus, this game is basically free. Without the Remote Plus, this game would most likely find good company in the discount bin.

Mafia 2 has beautiful graphics, a great looking city, pretty nice looking cars that drive pretty good, and a promising storyline.  But the whole environment is pretty baron.  The thing I loved about the first Mafia on PC was the open environment, the crazy cop chases, shoot outs with the bad guys in the streets, and in their black cars.  That to me was a great game in itself.  I even like the cop interaction better than in GTA.  But in Mafia 2, there isn't anything to do.  The cop chases are not interesting, there is no free mode or shootouts or side missions to do.  And that only leaves the missions which to me became boring because I don't like the control mechanisms and the straight forward linear shooting.

I am not much of a raider and often enjoyed Azeroth as a bit of a social game (which it has gone away from obviously) and a way to just chill and not think hard.  I am not a min/max player (those that focus on statistics like minimizing HP losses and maximizing healing and damage) nor am I to my knowledge a player that rolls his face in the keyboard in hopes of doing mediocre DPS.  As of lately I also spend much of my time hanging around with a few friends and so far we've been busy with life which leaves me to enjoy this expansion alone.  Granted I haven't really found WoW to be as entertained as MoP was.  I also generally don't do daily quests too often.  I play a pair of druids and a priest, the former is one on each faction.

Leveling from 90-100: One of the nice things about having less free time is that WoW tends to only really grab my attention for at most three or four hours.  I could play it more often but to me there isn't much to do at that point.  Doing each of the quests rewards a rather large chunk of experience and I would level up once every hour or two.  It was alright at first but after a while the numbers began to blur as I realized my usual technique of resting characters up does absolutely no good in this expansion.  Typically I leave my healer priest and my tank druid rested while I tend to play my DPS druid for a bit.  After a while I would switch and drain the rested experience.  Sounds nifty and works really well for older expansions but here the amount of experience gained from creatures and dungeon mobs is literally nothing.  Right before I got my tank druid to 100 I was able to clear Skyreach in about 25 minutes while gaining only a bar and a half of actual experience.  The other five bars was given for completing the dungeon.  Not to mention quest chains that on the other druid I happened to finish around leveling up so I easily began the next level with 8 bars into it.  Seriously just doesn't make sense.

Questing: One of the lovely improvements Blizzard added was quest items that have no particular use than to occupy space no longer require space in the character's inventory.  This is not particularly retroactive mind you, but it is a nice touch seeing how many quests require picking up items and such.  My only gripe is that I am not a big fan of the epic single player driven storyline.  I preferred being the grunt in the third person imagining of the beloved RTS games and being a part of an army of Alliance or Horde.  The whole world revolving around the player seems even more off putting with everyone getting a garrison and all that.  Needless to say the Horde side gets famous heroes like Durotan while the Alliance get new NPCs and lore (since for the most part Draenei outside of the Lost Ones were only apparent in The Burning Crusade).  Each side has fairly decent stories but fall flat when one realizes that questing IS required to upgrade the garrison and to reasonably level up.

Presentation: Blizzard really outdone themselves with the new character models and Draenor itself looks wonderful.  Even Nagrand while retaining its green grass looks much different than the one in The Burning Crusade.  The environments have a sense of being in Outlands while not actually being in Outlands and seeing landmarks in the past does give some awe as to what happened years later.  The music is the same greatness WoW has and it does occasionally throw in a Burning Crusade tune here and there.  There are a few cutscenes (some repeatable such as dungeons) and overall with a few minor exceptions the game looks great!

Garrisons: For me Garrisons reminded me of not so much FarmVille since I never played it but the old space empire simulation/strategy games.  While the concept of the Garrison was great one of the biggest flaws that irked me is the amount of compromise needed to effectively do everything.  Done with a building or need something else?  Demolish it and make way for something new.  Between that and needing to be in game it was one of those things that It began to grow stale after a while.  Log in, do garrison stuff and log.  What makes the Garrison more problematic is that its inventory is still your own (or in my case the guild bank) with all the mats gained and so forth.  The missions given to followers, or NPCs that are adventurer's like the player, is that the missions and interface are hard to use without any sort of addon.

CASC: One of Blizzard's new feats is a new file system to replace the antiquated MPQ that has been in use ever since Diablo which houses all the game's data.  CASC works in theory but it is sluggish, hangs on streaming WoW (on multiple PCs, one of which lacks a DVD drive to install the game) and overall not ready for prime time.  The other issue is that the battle net client I used to be able to install on any PC just for chat functions but that is no longer available.

Overall I give WoD 2 stars for the lackluster leveling gameplay, no endgame and garrisons that really undermine what WoW is about.",Warcraft 11,1424390400,,"{'Edition:': ' Warlords of Draenor', 'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'}",

The sound output/quality is more faint than the 8-year old original Xbox headset to the point these didn't feel quite ""stereo"".

The head-band part of this is not actually centered with the top of the earphones part like every headphone you've ever used, therefore, fitment is a little funky.  Unfortunately the head-band part lands on the pointy-est part of my head that makes this uncomfortable after an hour or two.

Then, the boom-mic is crazy annoying; it is a hard-kinda-bendable-plastic that doesn't quickly flip out of the way.  If you like to snack or sip while gaming or working, you're going to find this a deal breaker.  Now, true, you CAN unplug it, which is neat, but if you're actively using the headphones, you'll want to keep the boom-mic plugged in.

There really is nothing new or original here.  Sure there are character upgrades and looks that are new, but it doesn't make up for the lackluster gameplay.  The campaign is a dull process without much of a storyline.  Multiplayer is arcade fast and fun as usual, but it's like they took the maps for COD BO2 and just re-shaped them, re-colored them.

And who has the time and money for mediocre games?  After the towering glory that was Resident Evil 4, I anticipated a nigh religious gaming experience, and that was what I should have gotten.  And yeah, before you get all ""you expect too much"" on me, I'll tell you this:  if you don't expect a *hellaciously* good time from entertainment software that runs fifty-to-sixty bucks a pop, you're either eating dodo sandwiches and blowing your nose on Franklins, or you're waaaaay too easy to please.

Okay, before I go into my grievances, here are some positives:  I like the basic zombie shooting, punching and kicking.  The two-player mode is a terrific thing to put in an RE game, and the ability to revive your dying partner if you reach him/her before he/she sinks to the ground is really cool and dramatic.  Firefights with gun-wielding soldier zombies later in the game are often fun -- I was surprised at that, actually.  The female characters are really cute, and it was good to see Jill Valentine again (though I don't like how they narrowed down the womanly hips she sported in the Gamecube Resident Evil remake).

Now my grievances:  Most of the maps are boring, confusing, and don't usually support the gameplay mechanics very well -- it seems like they're either too big or too small.  With the exception of one in which you help Jill out whilst avoiding an invincible Wesker, the boss battles are all phoned in, the big, wriggly snake beast encounters being some of the lamest.  All the characters are as *blaaah* as they come, personality-wise; they just say the same dumb, flat things over and over and over again, things like ""I should have killed you years ago, pesky, foolish hero!"" and ""Hey partner, we're partners to the very end, right partner?"" and ""What are you talking about villain?  You're mad, mad I say!""  It's alright to say stuff like that here and there in any action game (or movie, for that matter), but not all the rootin' tootin' time!  And why did they turn Chris into such a 'roid monster?  Sure, he was a big, tough guy in the other games, but jeeez!  And one last thing:  the African setting wasn't exploited to even near its full atmospheric potential (unlike RE4, which takes place in rural Spain and has European gothic fLaYvA to the MAX).

Don't tell me this game is at least as good as RE4, because it ain't.  I went back and immediately replayed it after beating RE5, and it is just so much better.  Better gameplay, better graphics (yeah I said it, alright; they're not as shiny and hi-res, but they ARE better), better characters, better story . . . it's just better.

Durham,"When it comes to third party developers bringing established franchises to the DS, they either utilize just what the DS can do very well, they completely ignore what the DS can do, or they make a sloppy attempt at kind of taking advantage of what the DS can do.  The long running Guilty Gear series, considered by many to be the best 2-D fighting series on the market in the past few years, makes it's debut on the DS with Guilty Gear: Dust Strikers; and it does the aforementioned three things that third party DS games tend to do.  Utilizing both of the DS' screens for fighting mayhem, Dust Strikers moves the game's traditional one on one fighting format into an all out four player free for all, and it's not for the better.  Thanks to an unbalanced fighting engine and the game's haphazard use of the dual screens, the fighting action becomes nothing but one big messy button masher.  Not to mention that for a Guilty Gear game, there is hardly as much depth to it as we've seen before on other editions of the series.  There's also some lame mini-games thrown in for good measure using the stylus and touch screen, which are hardly worth even checking out.  There are a few good points to Dust Strikers though: the character sprites and graphics and animation look crisp, clean, and sharp most of the time.  Plus there's a heaping amount of fighters to pick from which is a nice plus for longtime fans of the series; and of course, there's a rocking soundtrack to boot as fans would come to expect, although it does sound a bit grainy coming through the DS' small speakers.  It's sad that Majesco just had to tamper with a winning formula for Dust Strikers, and it's even more disappointing at how messy it all turned out.

I was skeptical of this game from the get go, but now that I've seen it in action, I can definitely say it is not the game for me.  The gameplay is extremely simple, except for the simulated drums using the balance board, which turned out to be a little too complicated and awkward.

Overall, a lot of the motions and actions are kind of fun, but the game honestly feels like one decent mini-game idea that could have been pulled out of Mario Party or Raving Rabbids.  Then the mini-game became bloated, over-hyped, and then was slapped with a [....] price tag just in time for the holidays.  In fact, if parts of the next Mario Party or Wario Ware titles were to include a Wii Music mini-game, I think that I would enjoy them in small bites.

Most disappointing is the selection of music and the sound quality.  It's not terrible, but it definitely isn't great either.  Part of that probably has to do with making the game so flexible with the types of sounds that can be used to play a song, but the music is rarely emotionally satisfying.  A lot of classic Nintendo tunes I was hoping far aren't even in the game and everything else just feels kind of tacked on, although I admit having fun messing around with the Zelda theme song.

I can see the appeal that this game may have for children and families, but as a male adult gamer without children, this game has very little to offer me.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.

2.0,False,"02 15, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0002IQD1U,Lisa Shea,"An attempt to cross the Lord of the Rings with a Final Fantasy-style RPG, the Lord of the Rings: The Third Age is in most ways stuck in the shadow of many other greater things.

The main characters are not the main characters of the Lord of the Rings, but rather similar characters that share many connections with them. Berethor is the captain of the Gondor Citadel Guard, and is looking for Boromir. Idrial is an elf woman serving Galadriel. Elegost is one of Aragorn's fellow rangers. And so on for the other three characters; all are made in the shape of other, similar characters. Their activities and encounters all follow the Fellowship, even at one point finding the campsite used by them when in the mountains (in the first film). The objectives are usually tantalizingly close to the fellowship - ""Oh, that's our campsite, yeah, so come find us in the Mines of Moria! Oh, wait, we moved on."" Gandalf narrates the scenes ""speaking"" to Berethor, usually encouraging him to try and catch up with the group. Many of the game's boss fights are against non-canon enemies, enemies the Fellowship dealt with (supposedly), or enemies that it wouldn't make sense to have killed. As a whole, the story appears more like a fanfiction than a professional work.

The gameplay is reminiscent of most RPGs. Characters have HP and MP (or, rather, AP), and various class-specific skills. They can fight, use skills, use magic, or use items. Items tend to be LOTR-specific things like Lembas bread or Kingsfoil. Most of the attacks in the beginning are simply ""hit harder"" or ""hit harder against certain things"", but this later evolves into magical abilities as well. For the most part, the system is uninspired and not particularly exciting. The characters run around on the world map and have old-style random encounters that pop out of nowhere. The majority of the battles are fairly boring and have nothing to set them apart.

The graphics are fairly terrible. The textures are blocky, the characters seem mis-proportioned, the animations are odd and unnatural, and everything seems to be blurry for some reason. The voice acting is decent, but not spectacular; the characters seem chosen, again, for their resemblance to established characters.

As a whole, this game has nothing going for it. It seems amateur in many ways, and isn't particularly fun, either. Even for fans of LOTR, this isn't that rewarding because of the many inaccuracies and oddities present.

2.0,False,"01 7, 2016",A28L6ML1HQO7NO,B00EWEHI5K,J. Olmstead,"I bought this mouse based on looks alone. Bad idea. I ended up returning it and buying a Logitech G602 instead. My complaints about the mouse were thusly:

Biggest complaint - battery life. The battery looks like a AA battery, but is not. It's rechargable, but by the end of an 8 hour day the battery indicator was blinking at me letting me know that the battery was dying. Seriously? In one day? Lots of people have had battery issues with this mouse. The rechargable battery is a proprietary one, so in the instance that it completely dies, you'll end up going back to Razer for a new one. Less than ideal. The Logitech G602 was half the price (both were on sale when I purchased them), takes two standard AA's, and the battery life is said to be 250-1140 hours depending on what mode it's in. That's more like it.

Second biggest complaint - the receiver/charging station. If you plan on using this mouse with a laptop, forget about it. The charging station is not ideally shaped, so if you're putting it in a backpack or a messenger bag (I tried it with both), be prepared for awkwardness. Looking at the packaging you can't really tell that the charging dock is ALSO the receiver, which means 1.) you'll have to carry it with you wherever you go and 2.) you have to have it connected to the laptop the entire time you want to use the mouse. It's a big awkward thing to have hanging off of the laptop, especially with the included USB cable (which is extremely long). If you were going to use the mouse in a desktop PC setting this wouldn't be an issue, but if you plan on using the mouse with a laptop, it's a pain.

Third, the build quality of the mouse is iffy. I've seen complaints about this as well (I should have read reviews BEFORE purchasing it, I know... I know...) It's not like anything on mine ever broke, but it was ""creeky"" when I used it due to hard plastic-on-hard plastic parts that are adjustable. It looked sweet when sitting still, but sounded like a rattle trap under actual use. Less than ideal. I've seen others complain of comfort, but honestly I had no issues with comfort. The mouse was great to use, just the noises drove me nuts.

Fourth, and this is pretty nit-picky I know, but for the purpose of full-disclosure... The ""gaming resolution button"" on each side of the mouse is cool on paper. You can press in the sides of the mouse and it greatly reduces the sampling speed at which the cursor moves, which is marketed as being valuable in shooters where you are sniping or something and need great precision. This is a cool idea in theory, but in practice I found that the buttons were hard and awkward to press (this isn't the two visible buttons on each side of the mouse mind you - which are grey - it's the entire side of the mouse that acts like a button). I found myself missing shots and just not using the ""feature"" at all. The other nit-picky complaint is the color of the LEDs, which are all over the mouse and are green-only. Something to keep in mind if lighting is a theme with your rig and you're OCD about it.

Battery life was by far the biggest issue for me, followed by the stupid receiver. The Logitech receiver is MUCH better, being SUPER tiny, and being able to just use AA's is much better than running out of a charge within 8 hours and having to re-charge the mouse before using it again. I know you can use it wired, but if I wanted a wired mouse I could have bought a wired mouse... for 1/4 the price of this thing. Much happier with the Logitech G602.",Bad idea.

2.0,False,"11 1, 2014",A2YHK2NPB8KKT6,B00DHF3BZQ,The Penny Pincher,"I'll keep this review short and sweet and hit the main points of interest:

Graphics:  Fine.  You can tell it is a PS3 generation game ported up to PS4, though.  I thought it looked good except for stupid things like the main character's body breaking into pieces in comical ways and some other rough animations.

Sound:  Probably the best part of the game aside from the terrible voice acting.

Plot: Terrible.  Made no sense and had no real flow.  They tried to keep things ambiguous like a Silent Hill game but failed miserably.  I felt no connection to anyone, nothing was truly resolved, and there is no room for plot debate like Silent Hill has inspired.  Huge Letdown.

Gameplay:  This is probably the worst part of the package.  There are moments where the game shines, but a lot more where the game makes you want to break it.  It can be difficult, but not in a fair way that makes you say ""okay that was my fault""...it's one of those games where clunky controls and cheap deaths makes it difficult....well...more-so just frustrating, actually.  You will die a lot.  That is one of the points of the game.  So whether that be a death you deserved or a moment where controls stop your character from climbing on a ledge as an enemy races towards you...it's going to happen.  The rage comes from those moments where controls let you down.  They are not smooth.  I realize this is a survival horror game and sluggish controls are part of the genre, but there are times where things just do not work as they should.  Replaying sections of a game over and over again will always deminish the fun.  Especially so in a game like this.  Moments that may have startled you the first time are no longer scary on the 10th attempt to pass the chapter.  This game is full of that situation.

Horror:  This game is not scary.  I would call it a ""Survival tension"" game.  You will be tense and running for your life, but nowhere near horrified.  The highlights of the game were around mid-way through.  There is an area that I won't name where the game did get kind of spooky, but other than that this is an action game within an ugly/gruesome environment...and towards the end even that melts into STRAIGHT ARCADE ACTION.  Fear is subjective, I guess, and some people may find this game scary...but I doubt most will.

Overall I am hugely disappointed with the game.  I wish I would have rented it or waited for a price drop.  I'll recommend you do the same.",A truly hellish return to survival horror.,1414800000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You do nothing but boring gathering quests for like the first 6 to 8 hours depending on how long it takes you to complete them. All they do is act as a forced, overdone, unskippable tutorial mode. If you've played the demo you see that you get to start hunting big baddies right away, but not in the actual game which was very disappointing. Second, this isn't the best port. Get this for the wii u if you can. I know the 3ds isn't the most powerful system, but this game just looks bad on 3ds imo. The game is very playable without the circle pad pro, although it would be better to use it, the choice is really up to you. Third, this game has a fatal sin no rpg should ever commit...

2.0,False,"05 15, 2009",A1SHSOJRHEBL92,B0012N3T3Y,A. Nonimowse.,"Resistance 2 is the sequel to Resistance: Fall of Man.  It takes place, I think, in the future where an alien race has assaulted planet Earth.  Apparently they have the ability to make people into their race, or something.  I don't really know, as the plot is very uninteresting and mostly inconsequential.  You play some guy, a ""Sentinel"", which means something special, but I don't know what.  As you can tell I didn't play the first one, so maybe this is all stuff I should already know.  Regardless, it all seems very generic and super thin on plot.  I have not played in multi-player, as I have no interest.  Apparently this is where the game shines, or so I'm told.  I'll never know because it is unlikely I'll ever put it back in the tray.

The environments are pretty stunning in some places, the graphics pretty good, and the sound very rich.  The gun variety is lacking...  most of the time you will have the same weapon, or whatever weapon you have ammo for.  Since you can only carry two weapons at a time you'll be forced to dump weapons in trade for whatever you can find that has ammo.  Apparently this passes as strategy.

There have definitely been a few fun parts, here and there.  Some parts where the chaos of battle is thick and you are running around, immersed.  Most of the time the game involves cheap one-hit kills or times of nothing followed by a massive wave of enemies.  Rinse, dry, repeat.  While there is variety in enemies, there isn't much variety in game play.  Yes, the game hits all the standard FPS style levels:  Open space with big combat, open space with big bad guy, enclosed space with low lights and is kind of spooky, enclosed space with lots of bad guys, one on one ""big boss"" battles, desolate towns, and alien spaceships.  All very generic.

My biggest complaint with the game is that it devolves into ""Serious Sam"" style game play.  You'll, essentially, round the corner to find a gigantic pile of bad guys who want nothing more than to kick-start your face with their massive arsenal of weaponry.  You'll do lots of running in circles trying to track and kill waves of spidery things, packs of flying drones, waves of zombie-like-rip-off things, and big dudes with player-seeking missiles.  It gets old, and in my opinion is the mark of poor level design.  Checkpoint, walk a bit, massive swam of bad guys, checkpoint.

I'm not entirely sure what I expected when I got this game, but I was certainly surprised at the poor quality of this game.  Graphics only go so far, and a good concept isn't worth anything if it is executed poorly.  Resistance 2 wouldn't be a bad rental, or even on discount -- but at full pop, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.","Uncreative, repetative, waves of enemies and lame run and gun",1242345600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Con:
1 It's a Disney game
2 ""drifting"" slows you down (despite it's 1 of few ways to get points)
3 NO NOS or Nitro at all
4 No real control during drift. Hard to stop a drift and just as hard to control changing direction in it(multi drift multi corner)
5 Driving physics are bad. Many times your car will under steer for no reason. Brakes are pointless at any point. It causes you often to hit a front corner of your car into anything and call it a self wreck.
6 some times explosions and wrecks happen in front of you and you cant see what direction to to on the track, Not to avoid but to turn left or right for a corner. There is no mini map on screen or anything. Since triggers can change the track it's not always the same lap and if you can't see the route you'll wreck or get lucky.
7 tracks are short and repeat and lots of triggers do nothing to your opponents (even when they use them on you) they blow you a bit and cause a drift but nothing bad. Only a few triggers on the track will wreck people and there are only so many per track so you have to know when and where.

Nut shell this is a poor version of a old burnout game. I think I should have got Blur instead.

Pro:
1soundtrack and sound effects
2 looks pretty good
3 the semi race that's like death race meets terminator with beefed up 16wheelers barrel chucking at you.

In the end all of this combined makes it less of a fun race game and more of a strategy game. Building gauge to use only when it will work and avoid the places on track you know can wreck you, try not to drift, if you do stop before a trigger or wall. It stops being what is could have been and falls way short of a good idea that had promise. Save your self the disappointment of this bad game.

The graphics are super, the world is populated by interesting and often funny characters (Love the Dwarves), and Blizzard's support of user-created interfaces such as Cosmos is admirable.

With that said, I have to say I was also blown away by how awful the support is for this game.  After several months of playing, I'm cancelling my subscription.  I'll be doing that as soon as I can log on to the WOW site which has not been up the last 3 times I have tried.......

Blizzard requires elaborate firewall settings to download updates (They have been frequent) and has yet to address the frequent and irritating lag issues on some servers; not to mention the frequent and equally irritating crashes resulting in extended periods of not being able to access the game - something you are paying for....

Recently, 45 days after sending an e-mail to customer support (After being asked to do so) regarding a server latency issue, I received a response asking for more information.  Incredible! I had since started characters on another server and not experienced the same issue so I know the server was to blame....

Maybe my expectations were to high by thinking this game had a strategic element, for instance depending where I placed my team and myself the mission could be accomplished effectively. Sadly, that is not the case with this game. In SOCOM 4 you have to command your team to kill most of the enemies and considering there are very few places to put them coupled the limited amount of commands you can give them, it results in a pretty lame experience. Furthermore, you get killed very easily, specially in the higher difficulty settings, so you are FORCED to send your teammates to do the killing if you don't want to die repeatedly. That could be a plus for a ""realistic"" shooter, however its not accurate in its execution. For example, you can be completely covered, but somehow while recharging your gun a bullet magically hits you  in the shoulder and you die. W.T.F.

Its fun to shoot people, but its not fun that 90% of the other kills will be done by your team mates, who by the way, are 1/3 the smart level of the enemy AI.

The main heroine Aya Brea this time around, is so weak compare to her attitude in PE 1&2. They made her so defenseless, and boring, that you can't actually take the story seriously, because of it. And I'm being kind to the story atm, because it's pretty lack luster too, but back to Aya. Brea has barely no dialogue, which makes me think that SE must been paying the voice actors/actress pennies too none, because overall dialogue for everyone is boring. The her design is still great though, which give credit to SE of coarse, but overall I was very displease with what SE did too Aya Brea.

 I won't go into detail about the story, because it's really terrible. Either I'm growing out of JRPG's, or the corny stories are just getting old and more dry each day. I honestly don't know how you can mess this up with a great story/game like PE1. I guess it was pretty easy, because this and PE2 succeeded in doing just that.

 And now for the combat. Oh boy! Where do I begin with this disaster?  The controls simply put, are terrible. It's based on the infamous auto lock system, which controls the terrible camera too what direction you want it too face, which is based on where the monster is at. It could be left, right, etc, which ultimately neglects what spawns from behind you which = a easy way for monsters too get a easy kill. The directional buttons provide free use of the camera, but the monsters don't exactly give you the time to use that before they kill you. And now about the monsters/bosses, which are ridiculously tough this time around. It can be, because they wanted the game to be harder, or because the game is ridiculously short. I'll go with choice 2. The monster/bosses in this game, are crazy hard. If you've play Lost Planet, Monster Hunter, you'll know what I'm talking about + they regain health if you don't Overdrive, which Overdrive, is a fancy way to add more damage or transfer to another body before the one you're in dies. you have a last resort power call Liberation, which basically puts you in a special form for a ""SHORT"" time, which can either, Heal you completely, do more damage with energy shots, or make one final stand before death, and sacfice yourself for massive damage. All these things are great, but the monster still tend too have the upper hand, which ultimately kills the fun out of the game for some.

Overall I sadly didn't enjoy this PE. Instead of taking two step forward, SE took two steps back instead.  The hero isn't interesting. The story isn't interesting. The CGI is always great. SE is always on top when it comes too CGI and the art presentation. The OST is fantastic. It's the only thing that kept me going in this game, but the overall product just doesn't work for me.

1.  The City

Empty.  Lifeless.  Unnecessary.  It's so big, and getting places takes so long that it seems like it was done to aribitrarily extend the length of the game.  It would have been better to just have a map screen and a cursor option to click where to go.  The only ""things"" you have to find are Lolikov Balls (which help give you new moves you don't need and won't use), and dumpsters filled with T-shirts you won't wear, and money on occasion, that's so low in value that it's hardly worth the effort.  The bike doesn't even do cool jumps - it's a freakin motorcycle!

2.  Fighting Mechanics

Works good at first, but then try a ""free fight"" mission where you can't get hit.  Now have 3 of them surround you, and try to use an attack that hits multiple enemies.  You can't can you?  That's cause there isn't one!  Your charge attack, when it works, doesn't kill them all instantly - just knocks them down - and leaves your weapon without a charge, which means you have to run away to recharge it!

Wrestling moves are ok, but only useful in boss fights.  Regular henchmen are better dispatched with the sword.  The enemies get tougher as time moves on, which is made worse by a camera that conveniently forgets to show you there's enemies behind you.

3.  Story

The story is the only thing the game has going for it, if that.  You're supposed to want to be the #1 assassin, and you've got some hot Russian? chick annoying you along the way.  (I haven't finished the game, but I hope to god the main character kills her, it would make me SO happy).  You fight bosses who are all more interesting than either of the main characters.  Why do I care about Travis again?  He's not funny, he's not hurt or damaged, he's just a pompous jerk.

4.  Logical Gaps.

In one of the boss fights, you're tricked, fall into a sand pit, and get BLOWN UP BY GRENADES.  How does Travis survive?  The previous fight as you tricked and shot across the room via laser beam.  Again - you don't die instantly?  I thought you had a light saber, not super powers.  Oh, and speaking of logic gaps, the PAL game is censored for blood, so all we get is black particles and coins, however the same grenade boss STICKS A GRENADE IN HER MOUTH AND BLOWS HER HEAD OFF.  You're telling me that's better than blood all over the place?  (Her head is comically shown like looney toon charcoal, but we all know what happened).

5.  The gameplay

Chores.  You have to do chores.  It sounds like someone's having a little satirical fun - and it's fine at first.  Cocnuts, lawn mowing, trash pick up - first few times, OK we get the joke.  By the 8th time it's not funny.  Same goes for the over the top video rental girl who tells you which sexual movie you have overdue at the store.  Funny once.  A chuckle the second time.  By the 8th time you're just pressing skip.  The ""assassination missions"" (not to be confused with the actual missions) are well, boring.  You're only doing them to make money to get into the next fight - again game stretching.  If I didn't have to do that the game would have only been 5 hours.  The game is supposed to be a game - NOT A CHORE.  The game ALMOST got interesting after boss 5, but I'm still waiting to see something resembling vision by boss 2.  I haven't.

So it's appalling (but probably financially successful) to see them slap out half-hearted efforts like F1 Career Challenge, Knockout Kings and the NHL and NBA series because they know they can cut costs and production because the hardcore fans will ensure a profit alone.
Similar to the NHL series, they add a few gimicky features to appeal to the console crowd but take away more specialized features like adjustable AI, car tuning, race length and individual stats. The graphics are slightly upgraded, but the framerate, draw distance and control are poor. The engine sounds actually cut out when you turn the wheel!
It's clear EA used old code and slapped together some poor cutscenes with bland presentation (which is an EA strength). It's like a bad expansion pack for F1 2002.
The worst new features include a ""hot zone"" where you score EA cards and points for driving fast through a designated portion of the track. The screen gradually turns red the faster you go (think of the ""bluring effect"" in the horrible movie ""Driven""). And various EA cards pop up and distract you on screen when you overtake and take corners properly. Very distracting and childish. Console racers will never compete with PC sims, but at least give us the option to try.
The big career mode is a joke as you virtually have no customization options. Race length, damage, AI and even pit strategy are all set. You cannot even determine a tire compound!!
My recommendation is to get ""Grand Prix Challenge."" It is probably the best F1 racer ever to hit a console and it has terrific controls and graphics. Then wait and see what Sony does with the F1 license when Formula One 2003 comes out. I have a feeling they will take it very serious because of it's exclusivity and the uproar that would be caused in Europe if they screwed this up.

2.0,False,"06 3, 2012",A1TQW58W1OT68B,B00178631E,AM,"When Remedy originally sold the Max Payne franchise to Rockstar, I was worried.  The GTA franchise is a huge seller; let no one accuse Rockstar of not knowing how to make a popular game, but Max Payne had always been an extremely distinct, special experience, the kind of thing generally best left with the creators, I feared.  The game is finally out, and my fears have been realized.  There's no question Rockstar made a real effort; Max Payne 3 is absolutely not a quick cash in--but it's also not Max Payne.

Gameplay:  Max Payne 3's gameplay brings bullet time along from the older titles.  It basically has to; Remedy invented the mechanic way back in Max Payne.  It defines the series almost as much as the noir atmosphere.  It still works, but I find that it's less useful defensively than it was in previous iterations.  In Max Payne 2, I could turn on bullet time and clear a room, coming up smelling like roses.  In MP3, I'm as likely as not to come up smelling like the blood leaking from multiple holes in Max's body.  Whether this is because I die more quickly, or because I kill more slowly (enemies seem to survive body shots more readily in Max Payne 3 than before), I don't know, but the end result is that I almost always have to save my bullet time for shootdodging.  It's not a gamebreaker, but it detracts from the experience.

The difficulty on the whole is drastically higher than previous Max Payne games, something I've seen noted in more professional reviews.  Getting shot HURTS.  As it should, certainly, but the damage accrues far faster than in the past, and painkillers are MUCH less common.  A medicine chest on easy in Max Payne 2 could have 4 painkillers.  I've never seen more than two next to each other in Max Payne 3, and never had more than three at a time available.  In Max Payne 2, sometimes I actually got up to the cap, 8 bottles.  Between taking damage faster, and having fewer opportunities for restoring health, the game becomes substantially more difficult than its predecessors.  ""Easy"" isn't.

The direct result of this is that the player is often stuck watching the same cutscene multiple times, and putting up with death after death after death. (Who in the hell thought unskippable cutscenes were a good idea?  You can't even quit the game while one plays!).  I won't pretend to be a stellar player, but I don't usually have this kind of trouble in anything.  Rockstar's apparent solution to the game being awfully hard is to respawn you with full health, and if you keep dying, throw you a painkiller or two to ease you through.  This does help, but to get these nudges, you have to put up with quite a lot of dying.

Cover has been added to Max Payne 3, in the Gears of War sense.  Press a button, get into cover.  Aim, shoot, kill from cover.  This is the first situation in which I feel Rockstar misunderstood what a Max Payne game is.  You could call this modernization, but for me, the Max Payne games were fun specifically because I could run, dive, shoot, slow time, and generally kill everything in sight, without hiding behind a wall and picking off enemies from relative safety.  Cover is realistic, but the Max Payne series was never ABOUT realism; it was a heavily stylized cross between film noir and John Woo.

The last gameplay gripe I have is simply that your weapon carrying in Max Payne is extremely limited.  You can carry one or two pistol sized weapons, and one large weapon.  Dual wielding pistols means you drop the larger gun, as it had been carried in your off hand.  Again, realism where it's not needed.  Having a small arsenal at your disposal in the previous games of the series is a dated style, but it's fun.

Graphics:  I honestly have not got a single complaint about the game's graphics.  Max Payne 3 is stunningly gorgeous; Rockstar's artists, animators, and engine programmers absolutely hit the ball out of the park.  It's possible to grind the game to a very low framerate, even on a high end machine, if you turn on both MSAA and FXAA, but both aren't really necessary.  Dropping one or the other can help a lot.  Light works like it should, people look like they should and move believably, skin is well modeled.  If there's anything about which one could complain it's that during cutscenes, the game can approach the ""uncanny valley,"" where something looks so realistic it's offputting, because it's slightly inhuman.

Atmosphere and presentation:  This is where Max Payne 3 really falls flat.  Max Payne has always been characterized by really heavy ""film noir"" elements.  These are completely absent from Max Payne 3.  You do get Max's occasional self-pity, and drug/alcohol problem, but as portrayed here, they feel more like something on a modern crime drama than something out of an old detective story somehow set in the modern day.  Previous games carried the deliberately cheesy, over-the-top element of film noir perfectly.  Max Payne 3 makes the occasional allusion to it, but it's just not there.  You get a tiny, tiny glimpse of it in a flashback about 1/3 through the game, but it doesn't last.

I think the problem here is two fold: First, the setting change is ill-suited to noir.  Sunny Sao Paulo, Brazil is full of flashy nightclubs, bikini clad women (boobs in a Rockstar game?  WHO'DA THUNK IT?), and a culture so far removed from traditional noir that it just doesn't work.  Boobs for the sake of titillation and change for the sake of change just don't really work very well.  That the game is PACKED with untranslated Portuguese doesn't help either.  I'm all in favor of native language use, but there's so very much dialogue that's lost on most players that opportunities for good writing are missed by players who can't understand the language.  Subtitles are just captions in Portuguese.

Second, Rockstar's writers just weren't up to the task.  Max Payne and Max Payne 2 were deliberately kitschy, as noir generally is, but Max Payne 3 tends to fall back on crude rather than clever.  During the opening cutscene, the player hears a line similar to, ""I wouldn't know good from bad if good were feeding the poor and bad was bangin' my sister.""  Remedy didn't feel the need to resort to bawdiness to make the over-the-top metaphors common to the noir style.  There's a time and a place for everything, but when continuing one of the best, if not the best, third person shooting franchises in history, a little more respect for origins is called for.  If you can't maintain the style, hire someone who can.

Presentation is a real sticking point.  Max Payne 1 and 2 did have cutscenes here and there, but much of the game's narrative was carried out in highly atmospheric visual novel pages on screen, with appropriate narration.  It's hard to overstate just what staying in this heavily atmospheric style added to the game.  If nothing else, they provided the series with a strong sense of identity.  That identity was lost with Max Payne 3's presentation.  Cutscenes are how ALL plot exposition is handled, and those cutscenes are absolutely packed with some of the most obnoxious camera filters I've ever seen.  For no apparent reason, in a scene where Max is completely sober (and even if he weren't, the scene is third person and not from his perspective anyway), colors are randomly separated into red/blue/yellow, looking almost like a shoddy kids' 3D glasses effect.  In other places, color is strongly desaturated, or the view is de-interlaced (think scanlines, like a really old arcade game).  Words that Rockstar felt were important get plastered on the screen for an instant, but this provides no real impact--like the other effects, it's jarring, and detracts from cutscenes, rather than creating atmosphere.

Overall:  The package, taken as a whole, is a relatively playable game, with real bright spots here and there.  Unfortunately, those bright spots serve more to show the player what could've been than to truly improve the game.  Rockstar took one of PC gaming's most respected modern franchises, and I honestly believe they tried their best with it.  Unfortunately, their best seems to have required a ""go with what you know"" approach that makes Max Payne 3 feel more like a linear, third person shooter Brazilian GTA side story than a true Max Payne sequel.  Max Payne purists, those who loved the game for the narrative and portrayal, and Max Payne as a character, should probably keep your distance.","More frustrating, less fun than its predecessors",1338681600,157,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's glitchy as hell and the controls are so bad it makes the platforming parts of the game just an annoyance rather than fun. The upgrade system blows. There is no chapter restart so if you screw up you can't just restart the chapter. Instead you are screwed loading to the same point in the game every time. You would have to restart the entire game to go back to the beginning of a chapter. You can't replay cut scenes so don't press start or leave the room. Also there are moments that make no logical sense. Like, why is a gatling gun offered (across an arena) in assistance to killing a gatling gun boss when it can't actually kill him (the devs clearly didn't learn from Gears of War)? Instead he'll limp for about 8 seconds and you have to somehow manage to get across the arena to activate the quicktime event that will finally kill him, because if you don't he'll recover and shot the hell out of you. Prior to this arena battle the gatling gun bosses were all able to be killed without activating a quicktime event and sadly this part didn't happen till Chapter 12 (the final level). And to be honesty the game was actually decent up until Chapter 7. In Chapter 7 the difficulty suddenly shots through the roof, because somehow the bad guys are more resistant to bullets (including headshots). Also the platforming increases. Now, the platforming was always a pain, but it wasn't as frequent so the game loses a lot of what was fun when this happens. This game had a ton of potential. The grindhouse style in presentation is awesome. The graphics are really bad for a current generation title, but could actually be overlooked if the gameplay was better. Going from run and gun to sword slashing melee is a great idea, just not well executed. Bottom line, glitches and gameplay kill this game, which is sad because the story is really fun.

As a huge fan of the AC games (I still have every one of them and play them all even many years later!) I was aware that this Happy Home Designer (HHD) focuses solely on designing homes. I eagerly anticipated getting home design requests and finding out how I did on meeting the villager's goals. I thought of all the hours I spent collecting unique items in the other games - often traveling to stores to download limited time special items and happily enjoying visiting so many other players' towns hoping to find a rare piece of furniture at their Nook's. How I loved to send letters to my villagers and eagerly wait for their letters back - with the attached presents - some of which would be items I wanted for my house. As I progressed in the games and catching (or purchasing) needed museum items became more rare, my attention turned to satisfying Lyle and the Happy Home Academy. Pursuing expansions, going to flea market's, and exchanging thousands of bells with other players just to get that last item in a set were weekly activities. I feel like AC should come with the warning that you *might* need to go to a 12 step program before long as I found myself hopelessly addicted within minutes of every new offering.

So - 2 stars. One is just because it is Animal Crossing and there is some, albeit limited, charm in designing in this game. However the long list of woulda, coulda, shoulda built up by the minute of playtime - until I was spending much more time noting everything that could have been but isn't. Incredibly disappointing. So below I've expounded on all the things things that could have been.

I could have my own house to decorate - and perhaps I could have unlocked items or received special items from villagers for doing an outstanding job (vs an ok job) decorating their house. I could have had interesting, funny, sad, inspiring, or affectionate conversations with villagers while designing their house and when I finished. While there are a few gems here and there this game utterly lacks the charm of the characters. They can practically be interchanged - not much sets them apart personality wise. I could freely roam my town - visiting the folks for whom I've designed their home -- so happy and proud of my accomplishment. I can do that - but I cannot walk around to do so. It's only menu driven. HUH? Why wouldn't you be able to walk around your town and enjoy it? I do get that designed hundreds of homes would be a big town and rather expansive - but I still wanted to feel like I was part of the game (rather than an employee who goes home to a different town every night - I wanted to live there too!). To compare the equivalent in ACNL would be if you could only walk in the museum/shops area and the entire rest of the village (below the tracks) you could only get around to via menu and choosing a character to visit. It leaves a dead and disconnected player - without any connection to the greater whole of the players creation. Epic miss here.

OK so then I thought, well, focus on designing. Except I can do no wrong. I'm stuck in a Groundhog Day on a loop where I am perfect. It's pretty satisfying the first few times - but after that I must confess I wanted to start deliberately sabotaging what I was doing. Apparently the ""everybody gets a trophy"" construct has now invaded Animal Crossing just like the blob did the theatre in the old movie. No matter what I do the animal loves me. I can do no wrong. That makes me boring, vapid, and lame. I'm not a fan of those feelings. This is the part that is most painful to me. Sure take away many other elements to focus on the core of home designing - but for goodness sakes make it have some level of challenge or reward! Something, anything to reward my hour long work in designing the perfect home. Instead I'm met with the same ""I love it"" reaction from every.stinking.animal. This, IMHO, is the game killer. As others have noted perhaps a scale of ""that's ok"" to ""super awesomeness"" should have been offered. You could even OPT IN to this when you set up the game. Much like choosing whether you want to go easy or grindingly difficult in games that offer that option. Let the kiddies parents tell them to choose the ""easy"" setting if they cannot handle realistic criticism and encouragement. There is being creative and stretching your artistic muscles and then there is just mindless wandering without any aim. So far I don't even get a badge for doing so many homes or any sort of recognition beyond every villager loving what I do. That might work for 6 year old - but I want to have some sense of satisfaction. Even if the villagers had a scale - I would go back and re decorate just to move higher on the ranking scale. Anything to reinforce the value of my work. Yeah yeah - intrinsic value. I like both my own satisfaction and an external indicator.

To be fair there were enjoyable elements but the lack of connection I felt to the game (you cannot even change your clothes!) overshadowed all the positive stuff like a black cloud and it became pretty monotonous and repetitive very quick. It seems like a few choices could have been made that would have had a real measurable impact on my enjoyment of the game. In an effort to see if I can interject some more love for me for this game - I'm going to get some amiibo packs and go online to see and rate others. However I'm not a fan of rating others and them rating me. I want Lyle to do that - and I want to have to work to get a better rating.  EDITED: I did buy several Amiibo packs. For the special characters like Isabelle you can make her appear but she does nothing. You cannot talk to her, she does not interact with the villager nor the homes. She just stands there - like a hologram without a voice. I LOVE the cards (they are giving me the satisfaction I'd hoped to get from this game because of course I want them all).

I bought this with the new 3DS unit and I'm very happy with the unit itself. I love the faceplates and the smaller size for travel. However I'll be loading in my Animal Crossing New Leaf to take with me on my travel this fall. I think I'll start a new game (I almost always have at least 2 carts of each game - I like to have multiple games going at the same time) there. The bottom line here is no risk, no reward. It leaves you with a hollow feeling - like seeing a whole table full of plastic food - it's pretty and if you don't look too closely it looks appetizing but it's never going to satisfy. At this price point I cannot recommend it.","Limited connection to villagers, everything is perfect, and zero challenge left me feeling disengaged and bored within hours",1443225600,115,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'}",

all agree the graphics have nice details, but having ALL gameplay in 4 quadrants even in single player mode is annoying, lazy & makes it hard to see.
the instructions are vague but the controls are complex. I found the controls to be interesting complex like an old arcade game, but I couldn't understand what they wanted exactly. you never use the nunchuck for any game. all agreed the simpler the controls, the better it worked. I had trouble with response with even lifting/lowering flags in one simple mini-game & felt that you really had to put oommpphhh into your movements for it to be recognized (or maybe this game is really that broken sometimes).
there is debate about how broken/responsive the controls are or how much the A.I. cheat. some reviewers had trouble with the balance, but I excelled at it & easy for me such as balancing on cushions or running balance. I found the barrel throw was impossible as you have to hit A at the right time & then lift the wii mote in perfect even balance. I found that you needed to have split second millisecond timing for all movements in all the games which is VERY frustrating like it wanted to be a simulation. even firing a cannon had the arc & slowness for further distances like real life or running on a barrel had delayed response like reality.
This game would have been better if there was some humor involved, some of the sound bites help, but there's not enough & the A.I. movements are on a loop before/after or even during a game.
the only customization at first is choosing a family member from kid to grandparent.
There are different sections to play in a tournament, but you have to win all those games to unlock more games. only half the game is unlocked. you can do battle/quickplay of 1 or more games with 1-4 players at any time, but it won't unlock anything.
be prepared to see ""FAILED"" a lot & a lot of forced replay until you excel at games in order to unlock more.

this game had some great ideas in terms of use of controls & more complex sport mini-games to keep interest & focus, but because of poor instructions, small screen so you can't see ahead to time your responses, non-warned sim complexity, quirky A.I., inability to have different A.I. difficulty & obvious lazy/poor programing, this game only manages to frustrate.

Nana and Popo are better known to modern games as they appear the wildely popular ""Super Smash Bros."" franchise.  Along the way to regain their vegetables (perhaps a possible source for the vegetable themes in ""Super Mario Bros. 2/Doki Doki Panic"", as both games had the same programmer, Kazuaki Morita), the two Eskimos fight three main enemies: apolar bear, a Topi (a seal in the Japanese version and a Yeti in the Western version), and the Nitpicker.

Ultimately, the most interesting thing about ""Ice Climber"" is that the programmer, Kazuaki Morita, considers this game a ""programming warm-up"" for his next project, which would turn out to be the immortal ""Super Mario Bros.""  Morita went on to be a major programer for the ""Super Mario"" series, the ""Legend of Zelda"" series, and ""Star Fox.  After developing ""Ice Climber"", Morita was assigned as one of the main programmers for the original ""Super Mario Bros."" The characters from ""Ice Climber"" would go on to feature in the ""Super Smash Bros."" series.

According to Morita, the famous turtle cheat where you can get unlimited lives in ""Super Mario Bros."" was actually an accident. He is also the principal reason why fishing was introduced into the ""Zelda"" series, as one of his passions is fishing.

Both ""Ice Climber"" and ""NES Open Tournament Golf"" were directed by Kenji Miki, a long time producer for Nintendo.

Although the game worked well if you look at it in the context of arcade games in the early 1980s (with simple titles like ""Defender"", ""Space Invaders"", the aforementioned ""Mario Bros."" and ""Donkey Kong"", ""Pac Man"", ""Pong"", etc), today modern players will find the title rather simplistic.  Like several other early games in the video game canon, ""Ice Climbers"" would be a flash game in today's market.  The game does feature 32 levels, which does give some replay value and needed length.

Nintendo also released ""Ice Climber"" as part of the Classic NES series on the Gameboy Advance.  Although the game is undeniably fun, the initial listing price of twenty dollars for an NES game that is this simple is rather steep.  There are better titles in the Classic NES series.  This game would have been better served to be released in a complation of early NES classics featuring several other titles in conjunction with this, if Nintendo wanted to bring this to newer systems and still give consumers more bang for their buck.

The video game website IGN rated this title as the 79th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.

(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play ""Moon Crystal"", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.  The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ""Ninja Gaiden"", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline.  Absolutely amazing! Had this been released in the US for the NES, I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon)

As bonus content to the review proper, here is a portion of an interview with Morita from the official ""Zelda"" website from Nintendo around the time ""The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess"" came about:

""The programming behind Nintendo's games, and my own approach to it, has changed vastly since the mid 1980s. The first game that I programmed, Ice Climber, was my warm-up on the NES, then I dove into the fascinating task of working on the code for 'Super Mario Bros'. And I had a real scare related to that project, which really taught me the importance of flawless code. Ever hear of the ""unlimited Mario"" cheat? The exact way to do it is a little complicated, but it involved the player setting up a scenario that allows Mario to bounce up and down on the same Koopa shell again and again and again. Points go up and up, leading to a steady flow of 1-Ups. I remember when we first heard about that cheat. We got a phone call from some kid, and Mr. Miyamoto and I both thought the call was a hoax--that such a thing was impossible! The programming was perfect . . . wasn't it? Well, we verified that the cheat worked. Fortunately, very fortunately, the ""unlimited Mario"" cheat had a ton of PR value as word spread, because I sweated bullets over what might happen!""

""Speaking of other groundbreaking projects, I still fondly recall how games like 'Doki Doki Panic'--the foundation for 'Super Mario Bros. 2' in North America--really stimulated my imagination as a programmer. That game was released for the Famicon Disk System in Japan, which--back in the day--was a truly fascinating system from a programming point of view. Of course, disk systems are common now, but then we were just exploring how the disk worked as an immense memory reservoir, which let me toy with many programming methods that I couldn't do with ROM. Working with my design partner, and getting very little guidance from others, we developed 'Doki Doki Panic' in ways that really pushed my skills. I really matured as a programmer during that time. Very interesting work.

Looking back, I'm very fortunate to have been one of the main programmers working on almost every game in the 'Zelda' series since it first began, since my programming has helped make 'Zelda' such a part of history. Now it's interesting to see how things have changed. While I used to do all of the programming for NES games, now I supervise a whole programming team, though I still do code myself, too, since I believe that staying very close to the art of programming is extremely important. Sometimes I feel myself thinking--when I see what some of the newer faces around Nintendo are conceiving--that such-and-such concept isn't true 'Zelda'! Listen to me! I have 20 years of experience here! But, really, having the fresh thoughts of young talents working on 'Twilight Princess' has really opened my eyes, and that makes me remember those first days working with Mr. Miyamoto on the first 'Zelda'. It's always essential to keep your mind open and learn from new ideas. I've known Mr. Miyamoto for many, many years. It's fascinating to watch him work now. On the surface, he looks like a perfectly pleasant middle-aged guy. But watch him make decisions! His words are extremely precise. His explanations carry a lot of weight. I never fail to be impressed by how he helps people grow and learn about game development. Which brings us back to 'Twilight Princess'. As I prepare to cook in the kitchen, I'm seeing extraordinary ingredients coming my way. If our programming can bring all of these flavors together, and with our help also add a touch of light-world zest and dark-world grit as needed, you can bet that 'Twilight Princess' will be the kind of memorable dish that will live up to the entire history of 'Zelda'.""","Two Stars - A Programing Warm-up for the original ""Super Mario Bros.""",1326240000,2,,

The first Spider-Man The Movie game was a lot of fun, but it had it's limitations- it was too linear, there was no room for exploration, and your activities were limited to the skies and rooftops and a few indoor areas.  Spidey-fans and gamers alike wanted more room to swing and more opportunities to use their great powers with great responsibility- but less linearity.

S-M2 bucks that trend.  In a nod to Grand Theft Auto 3-style gaming, the city is now yours to explore.  There are huge skyscrapers, dark alleyways, and bustling streets.  You can either choose to follow along with the linear plot, seek out mini-missions that net you points you can use to purchase upgrades, or hunt down hidden items (for no apparent reason than a higher overall score).

While great in concept, the implementation is sorely lacking.  There are only a handful of randomly-generated mini-mission types (car chases, robberies, air-land-and-sea rescues), which forces you to replay the same tired action sequences over and over and over.  Fun for a bit, but not for hours and hours of filler.  The way the game is structured, you have to purchase upgrades to progress- so you are forced to take hundreds of these mini-missions to follow the game's main plot.

Swinging around the city is lots of fun, and you get a bunch of different upgrades (web zip line and slingshot for example) that aren't really functionally necessary, but still add to your enjoyment.  In addition, you can pull off weird midair Tony Hawk-like stunts (also purchasable)for no apparent reason other than that they are marginally enjoyable as well.

The main plot is well done.  It diverges from the movie and adds in some nifty comic book characters such as Rhino and the Black Cat, but the generally outline- defeat Octavius and win back Mary Jane, remains the same.

The fighting system has apparent depth, but most combat against non-bosses can be resolved with button mashing.  It can be fun at times, tossing bad guys left and right- but after awhile pounding thugs into the pavement or hanging them off lampposts looses all semblance of a challenge.  S-M2 is also the 700,000 game to feature a Matrix ""bullettime"" mode.  Yawn.

So much could have been done with this game that I can't help but suspect that we were given an unfinished product set to be released concurrently with the movie.  It is truly a shame.

*spoilers*

Storyline: Main Story
The main story starts out really good with the Normandy gettin blown up and Shepard dying. 2 years later Shepard is rebuilt by Cerberus and human colonies are dissapearing leaving no trace of what happened. Thats where the story dies and doesn't pick up until the end mission of the game. The game then focuses its story on getting more teammates and doing their personal background story missions. The main story takes a back seat to the supporting characters and there is no overall story advancement until you've done almost all of the personal story missions. In this game there is no feeling of a threat or danger from the collectors (the new enemy in the game) and noone outside of Cerberus seems to care about the human colonies going missing. The alliance doesn't even send an investigation team, they were so hellbent on Eden Prime when it was attacked in ME1 but now they're like eh, whatever. I was excited to get to go back to the Citadel only to find out that the council that is now in power because of the choices I made in the first game has no intention of meeting me and talking to me. Getting to be a spectre in the first one was a huge part of the story in the first game. I asked Anderson about getting spectre status back and he basically was like ""here you go"". Getting the spectre status back doesn't do anything, its unimportant and has no meaning and noone cares that I'm a spectre. The ""twist"" or oh wow part of the storyline isn't much of a twist being that it was used in a game early in the year 2009 called Gears of War 2-no, I'm not joking. Its way to similar to be a coincidence, its just plain sloppy and I can't believe noone else has seen or mentioned it with all the Gears of War references. Copying a storyline from another game is hardly Bioware's style and I was surprised that they did or used that in telling their story.

Spaceports, level designs:
The levels are pretty linear and small, they aren't massive and don't leave much or any room for exploration. I'm one of those people who like getting lost and trying to find my way around, so to me being told where to go and shown the way made it feel extremely linear. If I needed to leave the spaceport and had to go to a different system for a new mission, it was tabbed for what galaxy, system and planet to go to. The designs of the levels were actually done really well (Im no expert on describing level designs), they had animal interaction with the background environment and the levels had a great detail in the them but again they felt small and closed in not open and somewhat freeing. The develepors gave you a ton more galaxies to explore and very few were recognizable from the first game which really didn't quite make sense to me.  Even with all the new systems the game didn't have that feel of wanting to explore, going to a galaxy, selecting a planet to try and find an anomoly, it was tedius and what mission you did find felt like the same mission over and over again. Its also very easy to tell when you've explored a whole system because there is a percentage scale in the upper right hand corner telling you how much you've explored in that system and galaxy-gee, thanks for letting me know. One last thing to mention is every single planet is unknown until you explore it-are you kidding me?? The alliance and other alien races have civilizations on these planets, I'm flying around in the most advanced ship in the galaxy and they can't put the name of the planets in my galaxy map??? Its a small gripe but it goes to show just how little depth in these areas were taken into making this game.

Loyalty quests:
Your next of many quests and main focus of the game involve getting more teammates to join your crew, no convincing needed. After you've talked to them and learned more about them they will give you a loyalty quest. You get punished by not doing them, meaning you miss out on an extra power if you don't do the missions. Loyalty quests are a joke, they're very easy and they get repetitive real fast. By the time I got to my sixth, seventh loyalty mission I lost interest and care for the member and just wanted to get them over with. The best loyalty quest of them all, in my opinion,  is Grunt's, it's the most understandable one, it actually makes sense and the boss fight actually is a boss fight. Most of the character's missions are easy and if you're not paying attention you probably wouldn't even know you've entered into a boss fight until you were halfway done killing the boss. By the end of the game if you haven't done the loyalty quests you'll be wishing you had-they really make you regret it. You get Garrus and Tali back in the party from the first game, but why in the world do I need to make them loyal? They helped me save the galaxy in the last game so I'm pretty sure I've earned their loyalty already. I was also wondering how many squadmates do I friggin need!! I was fine with 6 in the first but now there's like 10-thats a lot of loyalty missions and a lot of talking and talking and talking. I like background stories as much as the next guy but seriously this is an overkill and a serious disctraction from the main story.

Romancing squadmembers:
Romancing squadmembers isn't all that great either, I had romanced Liara in the first game and when I met her in the this game, it showed the characters hug and kiss and then that was it. Well, they do talk but to me it didn't seem long and I felt gipped because I wasn't told much of anything (at least that's how it felt to me), no real detailed questions, no nothing-I was highly dissapointed in the interaction between the two characters. There is no girl/girl or guy/guy relationship, not that that bothers me that much, but if one I can do it in DragonAge and Jade Empire why not ME2.

Customization: Weapons and Armor
They took out the huge selection of different guns and armor. There are two different types of guns and 2 guns under each type for each character except for Shepard who gets to use 3 types of guns plus heavy weapons. To upgrade these weapons you need to tirelessly scan, scan and scan minerals from planets or buy the upgrades in shops-if you buy them they automatically upgrade and if you scan for minerals, you use the minerals to research upgrades for the weapons and again the upgrades are put in the guns for you. I liked being able to put the upgrades I wanted into my guns and armor as per ME1 instead of it being done for me. There are certain guns you find that are specific to certain characters but even they don't do the selection justice. So for example, Grunt gets a special Krogan shotgun and the explanation for why noone else can use it is because only the Krogan can handle that strong of a recoil. However, it also says the same thing for a specific Salarian weapon too-mistake me if I'm wrong but if a Salarian can weild it so can a Krogan. The overheating of guns is gone and replaced with ammo-I'm not even gonna touch that.

I only found 4 different types of armor and wasn't able get each piece for each set. Armor was broken down into pieces, head, body, shoulders, legs and arms. Each part gives bonuses to sheilds and other stats but the difference is minimal at best, and the player can mix and match each armor to their liking. The Terminus armor seemed to be the best armor in the whole game, I actually noticed a difference in how much damage I could take. There is no way to check your stats so you can't compare or see what weaknesses you need to strengthen up. As for the Terminus and Dragonage armor you can't toggle the helmet on and off which made for a weird scene for when I met Tali for the first time in ME2. Tali recognized Shepard before Shepard said anything and she couldn't see Shepard's face because Shepard had the Terminus armor on-you can also apparently drink with your helmet on too. My biggest gripe in the whole armor thing is the only person who wears armor is Sheppard, no one else, the rest of your team wears their regular clothing into battle and if on a planet that requires you to wear a helmet they wear a mask. It really needs to be all or none. Once you do their loyalty quest you can change their costume (that makes an amazing total of 2 costumes for each teammate) and for Jack's, she actually gets to wear a shirt. I don't feel rewarded unlocking a different costume for my character that I have to make loyal and you can tell it wasn't a very important part to make in the game, it seemed liked it was rushed and that they really didn't care about the costumes or why Shepard has to wear armor but not the rest.

Scanning minerals, buying fuel and probes:
This is probably the worst part of the whole game. In the first game you clicked on a planet hit the ""A"" button and got your mineral for some planets. For others you had to drive the Mako in some crazy mountain that really sucked-if you want more info on the mako read other reviews, I'm not gonna beat it to death. In ME2 however, you actually scan the whole stupid planet and it takes for what feels like forever thats even with the upgrade-yes you can upgrade the scanner but it doesn't matter much when you're scanning planet after planet spending anywhere from just over 10 min's per planet (with upgrade) to around 15 minutes (w/o upgrade) per planet. I feel like I'm being punished, its time consuming, not fun and mind numbing. Also, when you do find minerals you shoot off probes to collect the minerals and you can get anywhere from 50-2,000 mineral deposits depending on how high the meter is on the scale. So you travel to different galaxies and systems to find minerals and you have to buy fuel and probes which gets expensive over time to get these minerals that you desperately need. Also, if you run out of fuel going to a different system you automatically get taken back to the system that has the fuel ship (I wanted to see if everyone would die out in space floating around with no fuel)-so basically there is no point to buying fuel except to waste your money.

AI: enemy and allies
Enemy AI is pretty dumb, if out in the open they rarely took cover and even if I did get close they never tried to flank me. They pretty much knew exactly where I was on the map no matter if I was sneaking around or not. If they were near cover they would use it but still it really wasn't anything spectacular. One thing I did like about the enemies was that you could actually shoot their leg off or shoot the robots in half but I also think thats why the enemies all pretty much looked the same, there wasn't a whole lot of variety in enemy troops.

Allies AI was really good (to me anyways as I played a sniper where I heard they are really annoying if you were up close in the middle of the fighting), they helped a lot in the fighting and took cover in pretty smart places, I played as a sniper so I never had a problem with them taking the spots I wanted or getting in my way while shooting. I never could tell if or when they were taking a lot of damage which really bugged me. The health meter from the first was replaced by pics of which teammates I had with me and the only time I knew what was going on is if the pic was in blk/wht, meaning they fell in battle, otherwise I had no idea what kind of damage they were taking. Something happened after I got my DLC though and my allies started abandoning me during gunfights, when the shooting started they ran off back to the beginning of the level and hitting the d-pad would bring them back to fire a couple shots and then they'd take off again. Lucky for me the fights didn't seem that difficult but it was still annoying getting in a fight and then all the sudden my allies had left me.

Character Import:
They did a horrible job with this and made a lot of people mad, especially me. Basically, if you played ME1 and beat it and your xbox got the red ring of death (like mine) and you ended up gettin a new one or having it replaced by Microsoft then you had to rebeat ME1 on the xbox you now currently have-luckily for me I kept my saves and only had to do the boss fight at the end of ME1 but others weren't so lucky. It took me over two hours after I had bought ME2 to play it because I had to figure out how to import my character. A lot of people either didn't have the first game anymore or didn't have a save anywhere close to the end of ME1. When ME2 starts up it takes the lvl of your character when you beat the game, so if you started a new game with your char and had it up to lvl 60 but didn't beat it on the second playthrough you didn't get that lvl character. Also you find out that it really doesn't matter anyways, depending on how high you get your character that level gives you a few bonus things but overall levels don't mean a thing in ME2. Also with a series of questions you can change the whole game of ME2 from your original if you wanted to. For example when I ended ME1 I picked ""I don't care"" for who should be Human council member between Udina and Anderson-""I don't care"" isn't a choice in ME2 when getting asked the questions and I had to pick either Udina or Anderson to move on. So basically importing you're character has very little meaning on the storyline (some decisions like Rex can't be changed)when you can change it 30 minutes into the game. There is no point of going through this and why are they asking me these questions if I imported my character and choices in from the first game. I understand getting these questions if I had made a new character but not an imported one. Just another oversight in the developing of this game.

Character levels and abilities:
Leveling in this game is basically a joke-you don't see any stats, you don't see how leveling effects your character-what does leveling do?!!. I think you get to see how much health you have but thats it. The only point to leveling is getting points towards your abilities and abilities are far and few between. Your teammates have 5 abilities, chosen already for you,  and you get to put points towards them to make the abilities stronger and 2 of the abilities have to be unlocked by putting points in the other 2 abilities-it just doesn't make sense to me. The last one is unlocked by doing the loyalty missions for your teammates. As far as Shepard goes I think you get 7 but again you start out with 6 abilities,already chosen for you, and you just put points to the abilities you want and for the seventh one you actually get to choose but when you start the game over that ability is gone and you rechoose and get your points back. There is no strategy to this, you just put points in whichever skill, it really doesn't matter unless your lvl 10 or lower. The skills are on a 1-2-3-4 block scale, so you need one point for the first block in that skill, 2 points for the second block and so on. I read that people didn't make it to lvl 30 their first time through the game, don't worry its not possible-I did every single quest, side quest, sub-side quest and mission in the game. I made it to lvl 28. I know this because I listened in on every alien conversation I could, you get some side-quests for doing that, and went to every single planet (even searched the asteroid fields too, found some planets) in the galaxy trying to find missions. So don't worry if you didn't make it to lvl 30 your first time through, you didn't miss much and can't.

Gameplay:
If you've played Gears of War then you've already played ME2 in terms of being in firefights. Running around is just like in ME1 with a sprint button. Speaking of firefights, its really easy to tell when you're about to get into one. If you see a lot of boxes and places to duck and cover guess what???

Difficulty:
Normal and Hard are easy and insanity is either you have less health or their bullets do more damage, not sure which but insanity is only insane because of that.

Downloadable Content (DLC): *spoilers*
The dlc was ready from day one so why not just have it on the disc in the first place especially the ""Normandy Crash"" quest being that that is kind of a huge part of the storyline! I was excited to get to go back to the crash and when I walked into certain parts of the plane it showed what I thought was gonna be a flashback, instead it was pictures of the crew, no not only dead crew but crewmembers that were still alive. I walked into the cockpit area of the plane and it goes to showing a picture of Joker and not some really awesome flashback of watching Pressley getting blown up or Sheppard not making it to the escape pod. I was extremely dissapointed and very pissed off.

Conclusion:
Mass Effect 2 is mostly a TPS with very little RPG elements in it. If you like tps's you'll probably like this game, however, if like me and you were expecting a wrpg you'll be highly dissapointed. With the little to no control over customization and no (or should I say extremely limited) inventory it takes away from connecting or caring about your character and teammates. Since I felt that loyalty missions were an absolute must I had a hard time not getting annoyed with them and I was actually detatched from some of the characters I got late in the game. Leveling up usually means something in RPG's but in this game they are just numbers and thats it, I really couldn't tell the difference between level 1 and 20. Scanning planets, lack of difficulty, no suprise storyline typical of Bioware, unoriginal story advancement, loyalty missions feeling more like a must than an option and the lack of different abilities to choose from leave ME2 something to be missed. Loyalty and side missions are a joke-for example, getting ingredients for the cook is a joke and is unacceptable from Bioware as a quest. Mass Effect 2 is missing that Bioware touch that usually makes their games so special. I was expecting Bioware to deliver me that ""WOW!!, that just blew my freaking mindhole!!"" reaction for its twist moment and instead I got deja'vu remembering back to Gears of War's storyline. Mass Effect 2 is missing the quality and depth that Bioware usually puts into its games and thats why this game gets a very dissapointing 2 out of 5.",Can't believe I'm giving ME2 two stars *warning! spoilers*,1265328000,29,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

  The story of the game is very solid.  The storyline is nothing new though.  It has the ""old evil is coming"" theme. Of course, your main character is the last that can use a dying technique that is needed to save the world.

  The battle system is very simplistic at best which is ok.  You have to extract elements from objects to make potions and other things to battle with.  They give you two battle options.  These are to attack or defend.  The battle system is old school turn based.

  The art style and backgrounds are reminicent of Secret of Mana (totally unrelated SNES game).

  Where this game falls really short is the fact that your character is two dimentional  This is not a bad thing by itself but it tries to be three dimentional.  The game randomly pops up elements and items.  You can actually exit a building and extract all items then enter the building, re-exit and extract the items again.  You can build up an infinite supply of elements like this.  The problem is, the way the environment is set up it is hard to see where you are going.  Often times, there are areas that you can jump to that you can't see because the scenery is in your way.  This gets annoying very fast.  The character doesn't interact with the environment very well.  I got stuck in a wall, jammed up on top of a ladder, and just couldn't find the right place to jump to get where I was going several times.  I think if you could rotate your view there would be no problem.  I still am not sure why items keep popping in locations that you can't get to.

  The fact that the main character likes to yell out ""Barrel"" everytime he checks a barrel is also very annoying.

  I recommend staying away from this game.  I haven't seen a good game with the word mana in it for a long time now.  I would like Nippon Ichi entertainment to try again.

Without a doubt, the single biggest problem in this game is the lagging and framerate stuttering. I didn't think a game in this day and age on the 360 would ever have such terrible performance. This would be somewhat tolerable if it affected only a small portion of the game, but sadly it is EVERYWHERE. Whether I'm pausing/unpausing the game, starting/leaving a job, talking to a store owner, scrolling through a list of items, etc, there's hiccups and stutters galore. You'd think with all the processing power of the 360 at its disposal, the game would be able to load up a small, miniscule item in an inventory list without hiccups. Things really take a turn when I'm dyeing or changing my clothes; I'm talking delays of up to ten seconds whenever I scroll up or down even once on the list. This is all the more inexcusable considering that Fable 1 never had any lagging issues whatsoever.

Another thing I can't wrap my head around is the floaty, loose, imprecise controls. It's actually a step BACKWARD compared to Fable 1: the controls felt tight and sharp, but here it's like trying to steer a freakin' boat. There's also a slight delay from the moment I push the left stick to the moment the hero actually moves. Is there some reason why the controls shouldn't be as tight and responsive as, say, Saints Row 2 or Fallout 3? The controls become incredibly annoying when I want to focus on a specific person or object in the environment and I have to wrestle with the controls several times before I can get the hero to face exactly the right way. Simply moving my hero around and looking at things should be mindless and obvious, so much so that, really, I shouldn't even have to devote brain cells thinking about it. It is one of the most basic mechanics of a game, and shouldn't become a constant chore in itself.

Lionhead also made some curious design choices that make me scratch my head. For instance, why am I allowed only one save slot? Are they kidding me? Even back in the NES era, games like Zelda allowed more slots. Again, this is a step back from Fable 1, where I was allowed -- if I remember correctly -- three save files, and within each file were 5 slots, for a total of up to FIFTEEN saves. Why the cutback?

Another head scratcher concerns how civilians react when I pull out a weapon in their midst. If I pull out a weapon in front of a crowd for no reason, I lose points with the civilians; that makes sense. What does NOT make sense is that when I pull out a weapon for a good cause, i.e. to kill bandits that appear in the distance, I STILL lose points. Don't these people realize I just HELPED them? What, Lionhead couldn't be bothered to program the civilian A.I. to be able to recognize the difference? This annoys me.

Looking past these issues, what I've seen of the game so far is decent and serviceable: the main story is okay but not great, the graphics are good (although eye candy by itself is never enough to hold my interest), the music is well-done, and there's a good variety of stuff to do, not only in the form of side quests but also minor activities. I've really stuck with the game and tried to get to its heart, but I hate that all too often, playing this game ends up feeling not like entertainment but like work due to its technical issues and bad design choices. I've just about run out of patience. This is truly a shame, because I had such high hopes.

If you've played any of these games from 2K10 onward you've played this one. Yes, this year's game has a terrific roster and some good production values, but it feels like it was built on the exact same engine as its predecessors, only now they have altered the pacing through irritating in-match mini-games and adding a cost to reversals.

You have the feeling that you are not really controlling your character, but simply guiding him/her through a set of animations and quick time events. This clunky stitching together of animations based on context does make the whole thing look like a match, but you feel rather detached from what you are seeing on screen.

As a result, the player is presented with a clunky, antiquated game engine slathered in a vibrant and appealing coat of WWE paint. In that sense, it is the wrestling equivalent of Madden-an aging, substandard mess that manages to represent its license with enough appeal that you stomach it out of fandom and nostalgia. At the end of the day, if you grew up with wrestling and the great wrestling games of the late 90s, it is nice to have a new wrestling game to play. The game is good enough satisfy the wrestling urge for half-our or so, but then reality sets in and I, anyway, am compelled to move on. If you only grew up with these games, then perhaps it is good enough, but if you are a veteran of games like No Mercy and Fire Pro, you will be bitterly disappointed by this effort.",The Madden of Wrestling Games,1446768000,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The above mess is a Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince video game experience.  And I know despite what I write, if you're here you will end up playing the game anyway, hoping I'm mistaken.  I will continue if only to persuade you to rent the game at best or wait for the inevitable, monstrous price drop.

To Begin - The Story, Characters, and Sound:
If you needed to write a report on the Half-Blood Prince film, this video game wouldn't even be acceptable as cliff notes.  Scenes cut in and out, not caring about anything silly like making sense.

The video game starts with a random brush up with Quidditch at the Burrow and then bipolars you straight to the scene in Diagon Alley with Draco Malfoy.  Why?  That question should be read as a scream.

And from there you jump from moment to moment like a mental patient, who isn't improving.

As far as the characters in this cliff note of cliff notes, everyone is at least acceptable or great.  Great, as in the case of when the film actors lend their voice (the focus being on Rupert Grint-Ron).  The acceptable being characters like Snape and generally the look of everyone.  There is one huge exception:  Hermione.  The actress who lends her voice is fine, but the rendered character looks nothing like Emma Watson.  She looks more like Mema Witson, and while she's a great girl and all, Mema isn't in Harry Potter.  The real problem is that Harry and Ron look reasonably similar to Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint (having gone through the work in the previous game, whereas Emma Watson did not, to my knowledge) so Hermione, aka Mema Witson, stands out.

The music of the games is always either nice or fantastic.  This game favors more toward simply nice, but whoever thought that adding a record scratch to highlight an awkward moment between Harry and Ginny was a good idea; way to stand out, my man.  That was truly A+ dumb.

Well, I'd love to continue with my review, but I need to have a duel.

The Middle, Gameplay?:
The Order of the Phoenix game had 3 things going for it: a beautiful Hogwarts, most of the film actors participated, and the painting that loved Chops and Gravy.  Yum yum yum yum, gravy.  This game?

Duel, quidditch (by which I mean flying through stars), and potions.  Potions, duel, quidditch, punch making?  Duel, potions, duel, quidditch.  That is the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince game.

And while dueling is far more refined here than in previous games, it pops up everywhere, and all you need to do is knock your opponent down once with Expelliarmus (yes, I looked up how to spell a lot of things in this review) and it's game over.  And while potions can be fun, these are side games and side games do not a video game make.  I get the feeling that, oh hold on.  I need to duel again.

As I was saying, if EA would just put itself in a timeout and make a game based on several movies, we'd actually get an inspired gift of a game as opposed to these socks we keep getting.  Or even if they, oh, I don't know, gave a damn?  EA has done a Quidditch game before, so why isn't there at least a full on game here instead of Harry going through stars?  Why can't we control other characters in actual mission, versus doing the same things Harry does (how fun would a thought out Luna side-mission be?).  And whereas Order of the Phoenix was nothing but a list of chores to do, Half-Blood Prince is the same only with your mom running out of patience with you.  GO PRACTICE QUIDDITCH NOW!!!!.

The only beauty comes from a very beautiful source, the character of Luna Lovegood.  As you're lighting fireworks, and trying very hard but unsuccessfully to get a great look at Hogwarts lit by the exploding color wheel, Luna pleads ""I wish fireworks didn't have an end.""

The End:
This game was supposed to be released in November '08, as was the film (damn you Warner Brothers).  But stock market greed from Warner's pushed the due date to June '09.  And what did EA do with that extra time?  Worked on Madden 11?

But that's irrelevant.  To EA, this game was never meant to be anything but a cash grab, and all the extra time + 1 would never have made it any better.  Ever since the Prisoner of Azkaban game, EA's effort with Harry Potter has equaled my effort in personal grooming when I was 12.  Let's say, not so great.  But the films and the books have been about love and bravery and effort.  Where is any of that in these games?  Where is it?

There is no way to persuade Spain to join the Axis.  Yugoslavia signed the Tri-partite treaty and became a member of the Axis, even if only for a short time due to a British led Coup d' Tat. Turkey massed 3 million men on the Russian border waiting for Germany to win at Stalingrad. so they could join the Axis by declaring war on Russia.

I've come across quite a few and I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, picking up and playing through most of them.  The end result for pretty much all of them left me with the feeling I get when I take a bite of one of those fluffy French pastries with the powdered sugar on top; sort of sweet but filled with nothing but air and really messy at the end.  They try, but just don't seem to have the revenue or the skill to match their convictions.  It's too bad, because I'd be more than happy to give them an 'A' for effort.

GAMEPLAY-1 Star
For this type of story, I'd almost think they shot themselves in the foot by turning it into a basic first-person shooter, and the way Codemasters seems to do shooters is to have you wander down corridor-like areas and literally SWAMP you with wave upon wave of enemies at periodic intervals.  Kill all of them, travel a little bit further and repeat.  For this type of concept, a Resident Evil style of play would be better in my opinion.  Make it a little slower paced but more suspenseful.  After all, it's supposed to be horror, not straight bang-'em up action.  And the action is mind-numbingly dull, meaning walk forward, pull a trigger, walk forward, push a button, open a door, walk forward, kill everything that's not a team member while avoiding exploding demons and barrels.  Yawn.  That style of play tends to lose its impact for me very quickly.

STORY-4 Stars
According to the story, before God created Adam, He created a prior, sexless entity named the Firstborn.  Indescribably powerful but apparently viewed as a flawed creation by its maker, the Firstborn was left abandoned, banished from its Father's sight, to wander alone in a barren nether realm.

Jealous of the attention that it sees God lavishing on humanity, it resolves to destroy man and recapture God's love for itself.  It breaks through to our world at the site of Al-Khali (roughly translated from Arabic as 'The Empty Quarter'), an ancient abandoned city of the Middle East.

Strange sightings are reported from that area along with unusual weather patterns, prompting the deployment of a special team of soldiers to investigate, each gifted with their own unique supernatural ability.

It quickly goes south from there.

GRAPHICS-5 Stars
The visuals of Jericho are incredibly detailed.  This is the most immersive aspect of the game that I've found.  The creatures are grotesque, the zone in the desert you find yourself in is convincingly remote and forlorn and I LOVE the effect when, after one of the demons is killed, a swarm of flies flows over the body to devour it.  I find myself playing the game just to see that at times.  Your team members and the demons are also very intricate in their design.

SOUND-3 Stars
The ambience is wonderfully rendered through the sound effects, music and dialogue... at first.  It quickly becomes repetitive after the first few levels.  There are only a few points where the dialogue wanders off the beaten path.  That kind of thing only serves to remind me that this is, in fact, a game.

REPLAY-1 Star
I have found no way to get anything different from going through this game more than once.  It's the same areas, the same enemies and the same non-witty sarcastic remarks from your team members each time you pop it into your console.  I DO try to get something different out of each game or movie that I watch, but this one just didn't manage to draw me in enough.

OVERALL-2 Stars
Again, sadly, the idea behind Clive Barker's Jericho showed promise, but poor execution marred it beyond any hope of true quality.  Unless you're the type of person that enjoys simplistic gameplay, this game will probably leave a void where satisfaction is supposed to be.

2.0,True,"05 16, 2014",AJ1AOBCX1UU2Y,B0038KMNDQ,AdmiralP,"The ""upgrade"" I received likely has a minor defect, so my base opinion is probably biased downward.

The one I received, though brand new, starts out sounding as if the fans are really struggling to get up and running. Once they have ""stretched"" (as I have called it) the fans are not terribly noisy, but I am aware to some people any decibel rise is unacceptable.

In my opinion, the largest downfall is that the item appears to be making heat flow less productive. My theory is that the PS3s stock cooling is faster and more efficient than the additional hardware. If the fans are attached when I approach the system after shutdown I can feel (though have never officially measured) the increased heat at the rear of the PS3. I have considered the possibility this could simply result from the push of hot air out. However, not only is this emanating heat increased from instances where I have the fans off, but it significantly climbs the moment I proceed to remove the cooling expansion. This was glaringly noticeable when I needed to pull the exhaust for the purpose of disconnecting my LAN. My assumption is that the stock cooling is pushing harder than Nyko's intercooler can keep pace with. I feel it is essentially forcing a bottleneck thereby preventing the heat itself from be sent directly out of the console's shell.

Perhaps I just received a weak specimen, but I really feel this product is more of a threat to the rig than an asset. Once my Nyko fans have done their ""stretching"" it seems like the attachment is running at 100% of its capabilities. Aside from the noisy start I have no evidence to the contrary that my intercooler is performing at its intended standard.

As you can likely imagine, this fan expansion has been permanently purged from use on my PS3. It will never see use again in my home. In fact, if I could give it to any of you, I would gladly upon request. This is one of those products I just consider a loss and a learning experience.

It takes forever to kill bosses and when you die, you get to start that boss over which sucks. I was able to get to level 20 probably within 3 or 4 hours so it doesn't take long at all.
I have played by myself, but I have played more with friends which does make it more fun of course, but you end up doing the same things all the time.

The story is terrible and I couldn't really follow it. The graphics and the shooting mechanics are pretty good and for all online game it actually does pretty good but they should of made an offline mode too. The loot system to me seems so cheap as you go for so dang long in a mission or strike or whatever and you get something stupid or something you already have or won't use. The PVP is actually pretty fun, but not the best.

As well the loading screen is your ship flying in space...well what else is the ship used for. What is the point of getting ships in the game...to show them off at the loading screen...well that is just a dumb idea.

H30's water effects are the best I have seen since Wave Race 64 for the N64.  The music is a few alternative tracks, which works well with this game.  The problem with H30, is the somewhat difficult control, and the lack of Variety.
After surfing a few levels with various surfers, I was impressed with the graphics but I really didn't feel like there was a need to play this again.  There is little, to no variety in each level, and this makes it pretty tough for an individual to keep playing a game.

I've been a huge fan of the Metroid franchise for as long as I can remember, and Metroid Fusion has a special place in my heart since it recaptured a lot of the raw fun game mechanics of Super Metroid but it was the first (and only) game in the franchise to include any real story (and the telling of that story was amazing!).  I was excited to hear the prequel of these characters from Metroid Fusion.

...and instead I got this game.

The story was really hacky and the characters were totally out-of-character.  I didn't believe Samus's portrayal, and Adam was not even remotely how I imagined him to be based on his portrayal in Metroid Fusion.  Some of the other characters in Samus's squad in that game are kind of cool, but Adam and Samus totally ruined it.  Also, the idea of getting ""authorization"" to use weapons and powerups is not at all believable.  Having done real-world ""mission"" type work (let's leave it at that), you don't immediately handcuff your most valuable asset in a crisis situation.  Totally bogus!  I'd rather them have recycled the ""suit is damaged and malfunctioning"" plot device from all the previous games than subject me to that narrative!

And then there's the gameplay.  To say that the controls on the Wii-mote are frustrating is an understatement!  It is very difficult to effectively target anything for missiles, and constantly swapping the position of the Wii-mote is very annoying and not intuitive.  The ""cutscenes"" where you have to find something are also extremely annoying, as is looking for secret passages in 1st person mode after moving around in little bits.  Slows down gameplay and is not fun.  And the fact that they messed with the core mechanics of how energy and missile recovery work (and that there aren't really any new item pickups) also made the game less fun.  ...and the D-pad is a crappy way to move around in a 3D world.

So in short, don't bother with this game.  Though I'm always sad that Mr. Yokoi was tragically taken from us, it's a small mercy that he didn't have to witness this unfortunate entry to the franchise he started.","Never have I wanted to love a game more, and didn't!",1516579200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Moon,"Tenchu2 itself isn't an utterly terrible game--I know I've put in a good  10 hours or more on it, but what's frustrating is how there is so much  promise and so much failure both in the same package.  The feel of the game  is that Activision rushed this one out the door, and throughout the game  you'll find bugs, glitches and all sorts of annoying problems that would  lead one to believe that the game wasn't even beta tested.  Here's my list  of gripes:
-The controls are worse than Tenchu 1:  Of course, Tenchu 1 is  clunky but they are even worse here.  A lot of would-be perfect kills will  get ruined because what should have landed you right on top of your enemy  has you rolling out in front of them or some other stupid  stunt.
-Ridiculous AI:  Tenchu 1 did not have the best AI but it was far  superior to this.  I've walked in front of guards and had them not see me.  On the other hand, some guards are capable of seeing me through the back of  their head.  Also, guards quickly forget your presence and seem completely  uninterested in pursuing you once you are out of sight.  Yup, you can be  one foot away from them but under water, and neither can they see through  the water nor are they patient enough to wait even a minute to see if  you'll resurface (nor wonder why a bamboo air-pipe is suddenly sticking out  of the water.)  This is really a let down given that there were reports  that the AI would be vastly improved, guards noting blood running along a  stream or looking for fallen bodies (blood doesn't run down stream in the  game anyway.)  Other guards can see you without even being present.  This  is a neat trick when your KI meter is in the teens or lower and you can't  see anyone but they can see you.
-Graphic interface or whatever you want  to call it:  Graphics are just plain sloppy--my ninja is often teleported  up four feet instead of actually having to climb or jump over fences  anymore .  In the same manner, when dragging bodies I've been able to leave  them hanging in mid air, as though supported by an invisible floor of  glass.
-Graphics in general:  Sometimes the backgrounds go through  objects (IE you can see the sun and clouds THROUGH a wall of mountains.  Also, sometimes you can see guards out of your perriphrial vision but not  straight ahead.
-Inconsistancy with stealth kills:  Again, not only can  guards see you out of the back of their head, but some -cannot- be stealth  killed. PERIOD.  This wasn't evident until playing Tatsumaru's 'labor  shortage' level where certain guards could not be knocked unconscious even  with 20 tries or so.  Incidentally, this level seems nearly unbeatable and  I think gives even more evidence that this was a rushed job.  With 20 tries  on this level, I could not beat it, and I can't say I really want to  anymore.
-Difficulty level:  A good friend of mine nearly sold this  within the first week until we dug up the cheat code.  The game is nearly  unplayable without the armor, but it is almost impossible to get a grand  master, so you can't get the armor. This would be different if I could  start looting guards for blow darts on level 1, but even then, those are  useless against bosses, and between the combination of worsened controls,  bad camera angles and 'two hits and your dead' boss damage, Activision has  managed to take all the fun out of Tenchu and turned it into a tedious and  frustrating derision of the first game.
-Voice assignment:  This is  thefunniest glitch.  Sometimes the voices of the guards are the wrong  gender, and probably the glitch that had me laughing the hardest was when  the shark started talking.  C'mon folks!  The shark should not talk.  Please test your game before releasing it.
-Mission editor is a joke:  Ok, this isn't really a glitch, but really, I can't even make roofs in this  thing.  The saving grace would have been being able to make an island full  of cats or something, but all you get are boring people (maybe you can make  a bunch of godha's samurai and evil samurai line up like some insane  football game?)
My overall take on this game is that while Activision  certainly added a lot of new things to make Tenchu the 5/5 it should have  been, they lost it where it really counted--the outstanding game play that  made Tenchu 1.  Sure, Tenchu 2 has a lot of improvements, but none of this  makes up for the lack of AI, a soundtrack, good controls, and an  environment that reacts in a realistic way instead of one that has so many  bugs in it I never know how it will react.
I sincerely hope Tenchu 3  will be the game this should have been.  There are a lot of great ideas  here, but they just seem so poorly executed that it makes one long for the  game this should have been. It's still somewhat enjoyable (especially with  the cheat codes), and its glitchyness is sometimes amusing, but all and all  it isn't worth the $40 price tag--maybe you should look around your local  vendors...my used copy will be showing up soon :)",Disappointing sequel to one of the best PSX games ever.,967766400,10,,

However I keep buying the games each year in the hope they may recapture the magic of those games, This years edition (WWE 2K15) was a HUGE step backwards!

Being the first wrestling game on the Playstation 4 I had high expectations, these expectations were dashed within the first 10 minutes of me playing. I started a career mode, created my wrestler and then it shows me in the WWE developmental territory (NXT) where Bill DeMott yells at me for 5 minutes in a video scene that I can't skip, I have to listen to Hugh Morris tell me I am not good enough to make it in the WWE for 5 minutes before I can play (STRIKE 1)

They then randomly select me and another wrestler to compete for a spot in NXT (I was almost expecting them to pick 2 other people and make me watch them wrestle at this point) I start to wrestle using my muscle memory from WWE 2K14 on the PS3 but then instructions flash up, guess what? We have made the controls WAYYY more complicated so now you must spin your L3 and R3 in specific directions to perform moves (STRIKE 2).

If that wasn't bad enough old mate Bill DeMott is yelling at me on the outside of the ring saying the same 4 try hard phrases over and over while I attempt to make the most of my boring matches (STRIKE 3).

I am amazed at the graphics on this game! I got the wii version. The xbox looks like it might be better & you wouldn't have to use a classic controller with the game. The DS game is 2d but it still looks ok. Some smaller kids may have a hard time playing this game. the game comes with collector nicktoons mlb trading cards. NICE! the people doing the nicktoons voice,I didn't care for since I could tell that it wasn't the orignal voices doing it. Gir is super annoying & you wish there was an off button at times to shut him up whial playing the game. The loading screen look ok & seems to load faster then most wii games. the players themself look good!! I wish NICK would make a NICKTOONS DDR game. we should all flood there phones & reqest a NICKTOONS DANCE game with zim,gir ,ren ,stempy & others. we should also flood there phone lines & tell them to bring back the good old shows.

after playing it for a few weeks I think the controles on the ds version are better & more playable. the wii version controles suck! there were much better base ball games on nes & older consoles. It is way to easy to strike someone out. it to hard to hit the ball! you can not line the player up with the ball or run the basess. Someone said the ds loads slow mine didn't load slow but if someone is playing it on an emulator it would be way to slow to play.

I only have the wii & ds version & can't coment on the xbox version of the game.
wii has good graphics but the controles are crap .The Ds gaphics aren't good but the controles are better & I play it more then the wii version now.
The wii version takes a whial to get past the boring stuff so you can play as the nicktoons players. bumbing the wrong button takes you out of the game witch sucks.

2.0,True,"03 4, 2013",A2IA2PT6UYMR59,B003CP0BHM,Jared M. Stander,"I had a friend who recommended the RAT7 line of gaming mice. So I decided to replace my aging Logitech MX518 with one. After using it for about a week, I several huge problems with it that kept me from seeing it as a viable mouse at all, never mind a hardcore gaming mouse.

Firstly, it's not ergonomic. I know what you're saying. ""But the whole thing is customizable! How is that possible?"" Honestly, the adjustments are mostly cosmetic and do not effect the mouse in any way that justifies them. One example is the adjustable palm rest. I have big hands, so I was exited to be able to adjust the length where it could sit more comfortably. The sliding palm rest really can't be adjusted to any position which is comfortable. If it's close up against the base of the mouse, it's not in your palm, it it's in the middle, it's too low to actually rest your palm on, and if it's at the end, it makes an uncomfortable gap you still can't rest your palm on. The left-side mouse buttons likewise are irrelevant. You can use the included tool to adjust the position of these three buttons, which I was anxious about because most mouse manufacturers are too stupid to put these side buttons far enough up the body for you to hit with your thumb without having to readjust your entire hand. But the adjustment was not significant enough to fix this problem. It's so minute, I wonder why they bothered including it at all.

Second, the laser is terrible. You may have done research online already and seen that RAT7s have an infamous laser problem. These people are not lying. It often loses the ability to track vertically, and as I write this review, it slowly crawls up the screen, despite my having both hands on the keyboard. No airliners or freight cars are passing by. The house is not shaking. The mouse is just terrible. The DPI is high, but again, this is another unnecessary feature someone decided to put into the mouse but that isn't useful. I've adjusted the DPI settings about ten times now and not a single one of them feels comfortable. It either flies around the screen too quickly to be precise, or doesn't feel responsive enough. The default settings are a joke, and changing them involves clicking and dragging a tiny slider around instead of letting you manually enter values, making it a tiresome chore you will hate.

Which is a good segue into the awful software. None of the custom commands works. I play League of Legends, so I tried both some simple commands (bind 'b' for back) and some complex ones (a macro to type out MIAs, including the enter keys to open the text chat and send the message). These worked with varying success, but without enough inconsistency to say without hesitation that the software is broken and does not work. I have the latest drivers and software installed, I'd like to point out, but sometimes one macro to type ""mid MIA"" would work, while another which is set up identically, but to say ""bot MIA"" would fail. There's just no explanation. Sometimes the message would come out garbled and with extra keys, sometimes it wouldn't work at all. The side-scrolling wheel not only had not macro settings built in to allow you to scroll left and right, which seems asinine not to have, but it's in a place so inconvenient, you'll never use it. When I tried using it in games, it did not work. The problem I mentioned earlier about the left-buttons being hard to hit on most mice? The scroll-wheel is this but a thousand times worse.

All those other problems aside, I discovered that the 'back' side mouse key is mechanically flawed and will intermittently continue to detect presses while held down instead of registering as one long key press. If you're gaming and you have any kind of skill attached to this which must be held, you're going to be upset if this is a common flaw.

So all in all, the Rat7 is kind of a piece of garbage. It looks nice and has the appearance of a solid build, but the few adjustments you can make don't change anything enough to matter, the laser is terrible and easily outperformed by my MX518 from years ago, and the software doesn't do what it says it will in games, which considering this is a gaming mouse, is about as inexcusable as you can get. And for people curious about whether I was using the wrong 'profile,' a key next to the left mouse button which cycles through three colours indicating three combinations of customs button maps and macros for each saved profile, no I ensured it was always on the correct profile for the game I was playing. (And sometimes just for fun programmed all three profiles to do the same things with equally dismal results.)

Raillard,"I so badly wanted to love BF3 -- I had played many, many hours of BF2 and BF 1942 before that, and been enticed by the promise of the definitive Battlefield game.  The reality?  This is a good game, with tons going for it, but also a slew of problems that seriously hamper its success.

PROS: Great graphics, destructible environments (within limits, of course), tons of weapons and unlockables, lots of neat gadgets that add to the gameplay.  The play style has always been a bit more strategy oriented than Call of Duty, and lends itself very well to squad and team-based tactics.  Generally, this game is not an arcade-type shooter where you can go Rambo on the enemy (that's a good thing, in my opinion).  Some of the maps are truly creative, and the environments are really well rendered.  Play the Seine Crossing map or Operation Metro, and you will be in a war-torn rendition of Paris.  The new Strike at Karkand map pack bring back two of the favorites from BF2- Karkand and Sharqi Peninsula.  The action is tense, and definitely feels like a battlefield game.

CONS: Without a doubt, the horrible, horrible interface.  As others have noted, you have to install Origin, a clumsy, intrusive program like Steam in order to run the game.  Moreover, the game is started and controlled from your web browser.  Although the game doesn't play in the browser itself, you simply can't launch the program, choose single or multiplayer, and go from there-- you must choose all of your options from the browser interface, then wait forever for the game / level to load.  Single-player is pretty much industry standard for this type of game (read: short and very, very basic), and multi-player is what this game was built to be.  The matchmaker utility works okay most of the time, but takes way too long, and as others have noted, is plagued by bugs.

I am frustrated with this game.  On one hand, it's a lot of fun, when you can get it working correctly.  On the other hand, EA and DICE really shot themselves in the foot with this silly interface design and the Origin client.  As it is, it makes simply jumping in and playing take way too long.",Good and Bad,1324598400,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Another drawback is the game already feels outdated. If you've been spoiled by cutting-edge titles, such as Skyrim, with gripping graphics and riveting story lines, you'll get the sense that D3 was released too late. Don't get me wrong: it certainly looks better than D2, but not by a whole lot.

It is fun to see the gang back together, but the experience will never capture the magic that is Persona 4 Golden. The general plot is the group gets back together approximately 6 months after the events of Persona 4. Rise is headlining an Idol festival and she is having her friends come join on stage. This basic idea sets up the rhythm portion of the game. The rest is a mystery told through a visual novel presentation. The other idols that are part of the show have been kidnapped by some unknown force and the mystery team has to track them down. Not the worst in the world but a little weak.

Now I would never usually play a rhythm game on mobile, but with the Persona 4 skin, ATLUS got me. The game plays fine enough. The symbols appear on screen and you press the corresponding buttons. Seems simple, but often times the symbol correlation will change mid tempo in the song and you will miss a weird button press that you could have sworn you hit. Lots of people on Reddit and Gamefaqs have reported this issue. I don't know what causes it. It doesnt even happen all the time, just randomly it seems.

The characters models are very well done. They are snazzy HD representations of the crew from P4. Everyone looks great and their dialog avatar stills look well drawn and sharp. The graphics are probably the most colorful and fun thing about the game. I do think that some of them were aged weirdly (Yu and Yosuke) and have gone from 16/17 to about 25 in terms of look. Not the worst but still odd

The songs are catchy and fun. The soundtrack is mostly remixes of your fav songs, so if you were looking to hear the original version of Heartbreak Heartbreak, you wont. They needed to jazz them up and lengthen them for the game to work. Occasionally, you might have an original sound track song, but mostly It will be remixes all the way through.

You can unlock new songs, characters, costumes and accessories as you play the game. You play story mode to get points based on your performance. More notes you hit perfectly, the more points you get (duh). You unlock the stuff you want in the games store then mix and match to your hearts content in free play mode.

I will say I am not a fan of DLC in general and even more so NOT a fan on this particular item. To get the complete experience (all songs, all characters, and all outfits) you will spend an additional 30$ on top of what you paid to get the game. I wish there was a complete edition that had everything in it. Even if you get the limited collectors edition, you don't get everything available either. After two years that this game has been out, I think it would be nice if a price drop happened or heck, make the DLC free. Doubt anyone is clamoring for these paid items enough to justify their price

The DUMBEST part of the DLC items is one item in particular  colored contacts. You pay 2$ for three colors to change your characters eyes. That is beyond stupid. You cant even see their eyes well enough half the time to justify a purchase like that

I was able to get the game for about $20.00 and it was a launch copy. It comes in a slightly oversized box with a vita skin (for Vita 2000 only) and access to some vita wallpapers (boo). It was a nice surprise for the price. I never would have paid full price and am happy with what I got after waiting this long.

Same game modes, same game style, same issues, etc.  It got old and I figured that this franchise wasn't going to evolve.  I was right.  It still hasn't.  In fact, multiplayer game play is even worse.  It's the same old issues with P2P networking.  Players who are the host and those with better connections are going to dominate you.  No matter what you do, they will see you before you see them.  You could be prone and lying in wait and it won't matter.  The other guy will come around the corner, kill you and be gone before you can breathe.  It happens all the time.  Bad spawn points and map designs that are questionable at best, certainly don't help.  For long time players of the series, it's probably a massive disappointment......or what they expected.  Now, if you are new to the franchise, you might like it much more.  You won't have that stale factor that guys like me have.  If you want a chaos mosh pit and to run around shooting everything in sight, this game is for you.  Forget about strategy, planning or taking cover.  It's waste of time.  Just shoot and hope you can see them first.  I'm just surprised that with top tier games like Titanfall 2, Overwatch and Battlefield 1, that Infinity Warfare couldn't come up with anything else.

I am am Assassin's Creed fan but over the last couple years the repetitive features and gameplay have left the series feeling outdated. However, I have to commend the series for continuing to drive the Abstergo storyline with Templar's and Assassin's fighting over the pieces of Eden. No matter how you feel about the game, you can count on an even more elaborate telling of this crazy story every year.

I'm going to break down the Positives and Negatives in a list for a more comprehensive look at Syndicate.

Positives:
-Storytelling in unique and doesn't feel recycled. Two leading protagonists adds depth and choice to how you want to play through the story.
-The fluidity of the gameplay continues to be more and more refined every year
-The setting feels bigger and adding some vehicle support makes the world feel more rich

Negatives:
-Same Assassin's Creed formula (side quests to upgrade character, main story missions to progress story, Abstergo missions to fill in back story)
-Though they introduced the hook to move faster, get ready to keep climbing
-If you have started to get tired of the series, this isn't enough of a refresher to turn the series around

***I try to recommend a game in my reviews and if you want a good Assassin's Creed game to try, play&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assassin-s-Creed-IV-Black-Flag/dp/B00CX8VYM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag</a>. It is practically Pirates of the Caribbean but a video game. If you want something outside of this game, try the more recent Mafia 3. Though the world can be a little more bland, the story is great and gives you plenty of bang for your buck.

The reason for the 3-Stars that there are clear positives and negatives but this isn't the game that changes the Assassin's Creed series. If all you needed was a new setting and new characters, give it a try. If you were looking for a fundamental change to the series, this isn't it.

The maps are good for the mosy part, the new over the top gore is very much enjoyed, the increased hordes are kind of annoying when your stuck in one spot chewing up your ammo surrounded and can't move.  The tanks are not as cool in this one as they were in L4D1 and they don't look as good either, but still ok I guess.  The suspence/terror is just not there anymore due to the insane $hitstorm of enemies all the time non stop.  The spittler and charger are decent new enemies, and the game features good new weapons.  The new melee weapon system is great although after playing Killing Floor I wish you could carry more weapons, why must my handgun be hostered forever when I have a meelee weapon???  L4D 2 has great new features like boomer bile jars, fire ammo, explosive ammo and laser scopes.  The characters in this game are not as cool, interesting, memorible or fun to play as as the origional four.  Maybe sometime we could get a mod or DLC to play as them or have them meet up with the new characters, that would be awesome.

First I will start with the good.  This game uses a turn-based battle system where the enemies are positioned on a grid.  The top screen shows a list of the upcoming attack order, and you can use the ""change"" option to re-order your own team in the lineup, but ""changed"" characters will be at a defensive weakness until they attack.  You use your party's skills to manipulate the enemies around the grid, and if you pile up several enemies at once and continue to hit them, the combo counter increases.  Combos not only kill enemies more efficiently, but you are rewarded with additional experience and money if you execute combos in battle.  Overall its a pretty fun system that emphasizes planning and strategy, which I really enjoy.  Additionally the game has a pretty intuitive, fast, and well thought-out menu system, which is always appreciated in this type of game.  The ""Story"" tab in the menu even keeps a log of events, tasks, nodes, and dead ends you have uncovered, so you know what you still need to do. I have been making an effort to play this game with the volume turned up and the music so far is pleasant and appropriate, but with no especially memorable tracks.

Now comes the bad.  What could be this game's most brilliant idea, could also be its weakest aspect.  The time travel mechanic.  It would be amazing if you could more precisely pinpoint certain times and locations to travel to, but you are limited to traveling between ""nodes"".  Nodes are generally located during major plot events, with massive amounts of dialogue text and animation.  Each time you travel to a node you have to sit through all that plot text AGAIN.  Atlus even realized this and included a fast forward feature by holding X.  I have sat there and held down the X button for literal minutes while waiting for all the dialogue to end so I can regain control of my character.  This kills my desire to experiment with the time travel and see what happens.  Also the game is EXTREMELY linear at this point.  You can't explore any of the areas.  If you so much as walk  off the intended path, the character pauses and says something along the lines of ""we still need to do X, maybe I shouldn't go this way"".

As I stated at the beginning of this review, I am only about 10 hours into the game at this point, so I'm hoping the linearity eases off as I enter the midgame portion.  If things improve, I'd be willing to give this game a 4 out of 5.","Decent JRPG with a great idea, less than stellar execution",1435708800,,,

Bad: Missions not clearly defined and mission bugs. Like the one where you have to lay mines down to stop a tank; I wound up standing on top of it, throwing mines from the roof of the tank(??!!).

3.0,False,"02 21, 2010",A3CSRLMVQXJ8QY,B001TOQ8MU,Cliff Speed,"I wanted to love this game.  I've never seen the AvP movies, but i grew up enjoying the first two installments of each separate franchise, ""Aliens"" being my favorite.
So I had mixed expectations about what I might be in store for when I picked up AvP for my 360.  The funny thing is that I was mostly concerned with how the source material would be represented, but that's not what turned out to be the problem.
The game looks good, and pulls off much of the atmosphere and look that I was craving.  The interwoven story of the 3 species-specific campaigns does a good job of moving the action without getting too silly, but at the expense of becoming awfully bland and generic.
Regardless, what becomes painfully apparent once the novelty of playing a game set in this world wears off, is that AvP is really not a very good game.  The campaigns play like extended tutorials.  They're fun, but short, and once they're over, there's really no point in ever playing them again. So you're left with online multiplayer.
The multiplayer stinks.  From square one, finding matches is frustrating and boring.  You'll spend most of your time staring at a 3D facehugger and listening to an obnoxious multi-layered hum, and once you get into a game you're thrown from purgatory into complete chaos. Any game type that allows species mixing is a joke, but I'm getting ahead of myself.
The main issue here is control.  Each species has a specific set of controls that aren't individually problematic, but end up feeling all over the place whenever you switch from using one to the other.  On top of that, the melee fighting is so clunky and confusing that I generally avoid it all together.  That leaves me playing as a marine all the time, which is reasonably fun, but since my two friends who have this game like playing as predators, I can't develop a reliable team of marines to play alongside.
And that's the ultimate deathblow to this game.  Not many people have it.  It's not good enough to pull in non-fans of the franchise, so out of the 20-some friends in my list, only the 3 of us have it.  And we're already back to playing older, better games.

Well, that is what I figured at least. Unfortunately, the sequel corrects much of went wrong with the original.

First of all, Jak and Daxter is quite likely the most plotless and repetative game I've ever played. Yes, there is a plot, but the storyline has almost no influence over the game. You have to go around and collect little golden floating eggs and perform missions for random people to get precursor orbs. What does that have to do with the evil people you're trying to get to so you can transform your little furry buddy back into his even uglier human form? I don't really know, and after playing this game for a while, I don't even care.

Yes, the graphics are amazing and beautiful, but looks aren't everything. Especially in this game, where you go from one piece of land to another without even knowing you've moved into a new place. The problem with this is that the missions you have to complete are different depending on where you are. You could spend a long time searching for a mission without realizing you're not even in the place you're supposed to be looking for it.

In addition to this, you get three blocks of health to lose before you die. Unfortunately, it takes 50 little green things to fill up 1 block! What was Naughty Dog thinking when they came up with this health system?

However, some of the missions are fun, (although the races make me want to throw a brick through my tv screen) and exploring and collecting is a popular way to feel like you're progressing in a game. Also, Daxter happens to be adorable and pretty funny. It's worth a rent, try it out at least, and when you're bored of it, go for Jak 2.","Not my cup of tea, but it could be yours.",1091059200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

From there it's downhill.  The difficulty selections are laughable.  ""Easy"" is ridiculously hard.  Stealth and cover should have some meaning.  In this game it doesn't.  You fire on the enemy and a horde of enemies have you location absolutely pin pointed and they stay targeted, no matter how much you low crawl and hide in the bushes.  This type of accuracy persists even at night. I also noticed that when you fire upon one enemy all of a sudden a horde appears from all directions.

What is so difficult about adding a quick save, quick load feature into a game.  This game doesn't have it.  Instead we have checkpoints which can be painfully far apart.

I guess as a full trilogy, it can be interesting to see the story unravel but then again if all you are doing is playing the game to watch FMVs you might as well watch those glorious eye candy cut scenes on youtube, em I right? When they meant ""linear"" they really MEANT IT! This game has a point A to B system like ive never seen. Its just a few catwalks here and there; I probably played 10 min of the game but watched 30 min of CG. Also the story seems very generic, I really hate the one liners some of the characters use, they sound really cheesy to me personally. But of course every game I play that has a major focus on FMVS, i always compare it to xenosaga which i shouldn't, very bad habit. I expected something so much better.

The story told through the use of CGI i guess is pretty great and the graphics are just amazing to look at visually especially when you reach the wide open area in chapter 11. But the characters, i don't know how to say it. They just don't feel ""alive"" to me. The characters don't sound intelligent, you can kind of tell that someone that wrote the script for this game, didn't really put that much work into it. There are 12 chapters in total. You can kind of consider chapters 1-10 as being kind of a prologue to the actual content of the game once its unlocked. But once all of the features of the game become unlocked, at that point it turns from a linear experience into a more open world experience with no limitations in place. This is the whole ""reason"" for the three star review.

The rest of the chapters are much larger. There is also a ""TON"" of end game content and side quests. So thats good as with all final fantasy titles although the extra content is mostly just fetch quests and kill certain amount of enemies not really a variety of unique stuff to do like other games. One of my many complaints is the lack of towns, npcs and shops. Which were huge staples of previous final fantasy titles. You only really see the NPC characters in the game but you can't even talk to them if you get close to them they say like a few lines of dialogue but thats about it. To me that just kind of takes away the overall experience in immersing yourself in the world of the game and NPCS conversations always add more story development to the games.

Final fantasy XIII almost completely took away this system and instead its a pure walkthrough action based system. The point A to B system is like the first 10 chapters of the game which is a good portion of the game. It doesn't really open up until your well over half way through the game. After that though like ""NUMEROUS"" side quests become available that will probably keep you playing for hrs. Literally everything is pretty much locked to a point, even your skills from the crystarium system are locked until you progress further in the game. Certain barriers are put in place to keep your from advancing and I really dislike that in an rpg. When I play a game, I want to be able to go the distance as much as I can, rather if I over lvl my self, go out of my way only to find an enemy that obliterates me without a 2nd thought, learn new abilities that will help on strategically taking down boss fights, or put the extra time to create a solid team of characters that can destroy the competition. This game has put so many limitations not just on the exploration, but battle mechanics and gameplay as well, so your literally forced to play through the first 10 chapters or so and unravel the story in a very linear pathway, that is until you get to chapter 11 when everything unlocks and you gain access to lots of end game content and I have to admit the game itself has a lot of content at the end but unless you like grinding and grinding and grinding, it will seem pretty repetitive after a while.

The game does open up, you even get to ride the lovely chocobos around the distant enormous open world of the pulse region which diverts into many different other more smaller areas in the game. So at that point you have a lot more free form of travel. As you probably heard though, SE has really addressed a lot of these issues in Final fantasy XIII-2 and even more so in Final fantasy XIII lightening returns which is supposed to be much more open ended then its previous incarnation and it also has more vivid world with towns, cities and villages to explore.

For rpgs one of the most main important parts of a good role playing game is the story. Full well written scripts and NPC interaction makes you feel like you're a part of the story and inhabitants that are part of this world. You also get different personalities from various people that add kind of a higher depth to character development. Talking to each individual gives the game more story background and gives you that sense that you're a character in a story book so to speak. Instead of just being all bout CG, standing back and watching it unfold from a third person perspective like it is in Final fantasy XIII which i don't really care for unless its a game like xenosaga which is a game that is heavily story focused with a complex, deep and sophisticated plot with some of the most amazing characterization ever.

In any case, don't get me wrong, this game can be quite enjoyable, but to get past that first hurdle ""Chapters 1-10"" which takes up a quite a large portion of the game. If you can manage to get past that, you will be rewarded with a much more open world experience and a more free-form style of play like most of your traditional final fantasy games.",Many traditional Elements Stripped away with limitations but a very gorgious asthetic and detailed visual world brought to life,1446940800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

One other thing that I look at is re-playability, or the tasty challenges one can complete that keep you playing once the game has been beaten - Blood Stone wasn't much for this at all. Ugh.

The levels are pretty straight-forward, although one can get lost without the smartphone Bond is provided which literally needs to guide you to certain points in the level. In my opinion, this should come through a gamer's intuition.

PROS
Good graphics
Daniel Craig and Judy Dench star
Decent multiplayer over PS3 network
Joss Stone as a Bond Girl? cool

CONS
Auto-regenerating health (cop-out in my opinion)
Short storyline - completed in 2 days
Not challenging - my longest impasse was 4 deaths, not on bosses.
Bosses too easy
You can only possess 2 weapons at a time, one being the PP7

My best advice... if you have a PS2 or an earlier PS3 which plays PS2 games as well, pick up EVERYTHING OR NOTHING - closest thing to Goldeneye 007 in my opinion with TONS of re-playable challenges and rewards.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Ever since ZombiU has been said to not sell well, Ubisoft always has some sort of stink eye pointed towards Nintendo. They delayed Rayman Legends to the same month as Grand Theft Auto V and was no longer exclusive to Wii U, they canceled a Wii U party game that critics say actually would've been fun, and they ported ZombiU to Xbox One and Playstation 4 as a digital budget title. However, Ubisoft steps to the mic and says ""Well look at this! We've got a game based on one of the greatest Disney XD shows yet! And it's exclusive to a Nintendo console!"" The crowd of Gravity Falls fans cheers briefly until a gamer asks ""But is it going to be fun?"" Ubisoft responds with a memorable ""Ummm........"" before getting security to escort the gamer out of the audience.

I would normally dismiss cartoon-based games with middling expectations, but Gravity Falls has always been a top-tier property in my eyes, and it's clear that it would make for great video game material on account of the overall concept of the show and its tendency to make clever video game references since the writers are big fans of what they reference. Even though the creator and writers supposed helped make this game, however, it doesn't seem like they had the creative control that titles like South Park: The Stick of Truth and The Simpsons Game boasted beforehand, rather do they only come in when Ubisoft tells them to.

So, Gravity Falls: Legend of the Gnome Gemulets is a 2D platformer which uses the UbiArt engine that Rayman proudly wore during his reclaim to fame; in fact, even the gameplay mechanics do feel like that of Rayman Origins to a certain extent. The presentation ain't too bad either, as the graphics are as colorful and lush as in the cartoon itself, and the soundtrack is relaxing, but catchy at the same time. Unfortunately, these aspects are pitted against very dull and average level design that takes no advantage of the gameplay to provide something fun to traverse through. Granted, there are some puzzle bits involving switching between main characters Dipper and Mabel to help clear a path for each other, but what made the modern Rayman games amazing was how varied, interesting, and dynamic everything was! It flourishes within its own cartoon-y rhythm, and it's an absolute shame Ubisoft couldn't give Gravity Falls a similar treatment.

Probably the best part about the game is indeed its writing; even though it's read in the static text-bubble dialogue fashion, it does make me laugh and is faithful to the show. It doesn't really matter much, however, if the process of getting to read this stuff ends up being boring. If the levels felt rather tedious, the bosses will surely drive this tedium home since each one is a variation of the same exact thing, including the final boss! The game lasted me three and a half hours, but it did honestly feel like I was taking a longer time since I wasn't having as much fun with this game as I thought I would. It isn't quite a BAD game altogether, but a remarkably bland one, and with a name like Gravity Falls and an engine used in the best of Rayman's lineup, I expected much more.",Just stick with the cartoon itself,1455494400,4,,

Pros:
- Solid gameplay. Cover system works fine. Bullet curving and bullet time are fun and easy to use. The game also offers an acceptable amount of variety in gameplay mechanisms.
- Graphics aren't bad. They're not great, but good enough to be a current-gen game.
- Dialogues are good. I never read the comic version, but they give the same feelings with dialogues from the movie (which is good enough for me).
- Bullet cam is killer. It satisfies every time you see a bullet fly into an enemy. It happens randomly, so it's not too much (you could also set the option to 'Cinematic' and makes it happen every time if you'd like).

Cons:
- The game is way too short. I understand that the game was built around a handful of solid mechanisms, but 4-5 hours total is too short.
- More guns, and also grenades, would be greatly appreciated, and they would add a lot of variety to the game.
- Levels are a little too linear and kinda feel alike. The locations change, but they don't affect how you play or how enemies position themselves.
- There are some unlockables, but they're not really that appealing.
- Story could be a little confusing if you never watched the movie. I never read the comic so I couldn't tell how much it follows the comic or not at all.

In Conclusion:
Overall is 3.5 star for me. You don't have to read the comic to enjoy the game, but at least you should watch the movie. Even though the length and replay value of the game don't really deserve its full price, but now that the price dropped, it's worth checking out.

Cons: There are no tutorials or levels, so everybody is just thrown into the dance and you just have to try and keep up.  If you are having difficulty doing a move there is no slowing it down, you just have to try and try again.  This is where Dance Central on XBox Kinect blows this game out of the water.  If you are going to be frustrated by not being able to learn all the dance moves properly I would suggest the other one.

My kids all seem to enjoy this one, and it doesn't really care if you are accurate or not, my four year old does not care what his score is, he just enjoys trying to do the moves.

I just wish they had the tutorials and the levels (easy, middle, advanced) that Dance Central has, it would make this a much better game.

The main reason for this is the inability to change the genre. eventually they'll run out of tricks to motion capture and jumping up and down will get boring, until then have fun. My biggest problem with this game is that it seems like more of an add on pack than a sequel to the first game.
Newcomers `Crave' created a fantastic game engine with Tony Hawk's 1 and it seems that they have been all but forgotten, remember without their game engine their would be no Tony Hawks 2. The developers of TH2 (Activision) merely added some new skins and levels and released it under their name.

So really all you're paying for is the piece of paper with the activation code that comes in the DVD case. There are four games in this package, each requires a download of around 2GB ~ 4GB+ to install.

Ok, I should have known better. I'm one of the many people that even today who don't have high-speed broadband. I live in a rural area that isn't served by any of the regular ISPs. So I make do with dial-up and a cellular 4G MiFi service. Sure the 4G is high speed, but I'm limited to 5GB a month. So to get just one of these games, I would have to use up the bulk of my monthly data plan, or spend $10 per GB to buy extra.

First off, the graphics are surprisingly colorful. Sure, they don't really surpass anything in technical standards, but there is certainly quite the eye candy! The gigantic enemies in the campaign don't look half-bad either. There's a lot to look at on them!

On to the actual gameplay...
If there's one thing TTT really succeeds in doing, it's creating a sense of total destruction. EVERYTHING in the game's worlds is destructible! Don't feel like going around buildings? BLOW THEM UP INSTEAD! Explode everything in sight! The game already becomes mindless fun by this point.
However, it's not the destruction of entire cities that is the goal. The game is really about multiplayer frenzy and killer robotic bees, ants, giant dragons, a giant octopus, etc, etc.

The multiplayer is perhaps the most fun you'll have with the game. It is undeniably frantic and utter chaos as you guys try shooting at each other with your tanks' guns. What's also cool is that strategy can come to play at times when it comes to your surroundings and the types of items you use. Unfortunately, I hear the Wii U game lacks any kind of online play, which is really disappointing considering how much fun it is.

The single-player mode can also be pretty hectic, but is arguably more fun when playing with friends. Nevertheless, I found the campaign to be satisfying, and there is a nice variety of enemies to fight off. It's nothing deep, but it's fun anyway.

Sadly, that's all the game has to offer (The Wii U game's only additional content is a ""Kong"" mode, in which one person plays as a gigantic robotic gorilla while the other players take that person down). As an arcade title, Tank Tank Tank is a blast! However, it just shouldn't be a $30 retail Wii U title. The masses are expecting much more from games nowadays, and unless Tank Tank Tank is going to be put into a bargain bin for under $15, your only option is to find the game at an arcade.",Not enough content,1360368000,,,

However, I would highly recommend getting the HOUSE OF THE DEAD series or DEAD SPACE EXTRACTION first.  Especially HOUSE OF THE DEAD OVERKILL.  There's a lot more blood and gore when you blast the zombies, and the gameplay is more dynamic.  Also the dialogue and story are punchier and more fun.  And the soundtrack rocks.  The only problem with HOTD OVERKILL is that it's way too short.  Whereas not as tongue and cheek, DEAD SPACE EXTRACTION is pretty solid all the way around, and the TELEKINESIS feature makes it much more interactive than your typical light gun rail shooter.

Having developed Operation Flashpoint and various real-life computer sims for the military, the folks at Bohemia know what they're doing when it comes to delivering the goods in a recreation of ultra deadly large-scale modern combat engagement.

ArmA attempts to simulate the ""anonymous firepower"" of being a soldier in combined arms warfare. Set on a fictional sprawling island nation, (that conveniently mirrors the terrain of a Middle Eastern country) you will participate in urban patrols, meeting engagements, recon missions, tank killer assignments, armored combat, and even pilot a helicopter! If there's a scenario you can think of in modern combat, it's probably in the campaign. If not, you can always make a new mission in the included mission creator.

As much as the game does right, ArmA stumbles in a few key areas. First, the graphics, while not ugly, aren't quite up to the eye candy standards set by shooters like Call of Duty 4 or Crysis. Speaking of which, if there's a scale going from Doom-type action and full-blown simulations like Harpoon, then ArmA falls closer to the sim side. There's no ""run & gun"" here which could be a positive except the enemy AI is clearly not good enough to pull this off. Instead of programming a challenging AI, Bohemia opted to increase the enemy's marksmanship until everyone but you seems to be a sniper.

Seeing as how this comes from the same group that made Opera Mini, it is a huge disappointment.  Despite the fact it's an overall disappointment I still think the DS Browser is better than nothing.

The navigation is about as easy as you would expect.  You tap links to open them and you drag pages up and down to read them.  The responsiveness is pretty shoddy when a large page is loading, but when it's fully loaded you shouldn't have too much trouble.

The split screen provides a nice browsing experience too.  It makes reading long articles much easier.  Also, in SSR mode you get a page overview on one screen and a zoomed view on the other.  You can swap the screens but it's kind of slow.  I would've thought better of this feature if the screen swap was only a couple seconds wait.

You're given pretty standard options at the bottom.  Forward, Back, Stop, Refresh, Bookmarks, Options and Search to name a few.  I don't think they left out any important features.  Although an RSS reader could've been a nice touch.

Pages and images are rendered pretty accurately, assuming they're low on Flash, Java and movie objects.  The browser supports javascript but some advanced pages won't render correctly (Google Reader is one).

The major failing of this browser is in the poor hardware and the lack of attention to that fact.  The DS Lite doesn't have enough memory to load entire webpages so they added a cartridge.  Still, the cartridge memory is much slower than internal memory.  The extra memory still isn't enough in some cases.  I've been to a few pages that simply could not be loaded due to low memory.  Despite these facts they still could've salvaged this browser by providing an optimizing proxy server.  I'm totally surprised this didn't dawn on them since Opera Mini uses this technique, beautifully I might add.  Seeing as how they didn't do that I would expect the browser to load content on demand.  Nope.  If you go to a page with 5MB of data the browser will load it all at once.

So basically, if you don't mind long load times, frequent unresponsiveness and the inability to completely load a few pages I think you'll get your money's worth.

Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles is a prequel of sorts as you play as deadly assassin Altair and take on some Price of Persia-esque platforming gameplay.  Despite the 3-D environments, Assassin's Creed is more in tune of being a side scroller, which makes the game feel all the more linear.  However, the game looks surprisingly good and well rendered, even though there is a somewhat choppy frame rate.  The platforming elements is where Assassin's Creed on the DS shines, but the game's combat system is disappointingly shallow, while the game also offers some moderately enjoyable touch screen features.  The game also features some great sound design borrowed from its console brethren, which is a big plus as well.  Finally, the game is sadly quite short.  You can get through Assassin's Creed in one sitting, and the game isn't all that difficult either minus some checkpoint glitches which are more annoying than anything else.  Despite its drawbacks, Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles is a fun diversion while it lasts, and is definitely worth a look for platform loving DS owners or fans of the franchise, but whether or not it is worth picking up is entirely up to you.",Enjoyable while it lasts,1202256000,8,,

Durham,"Capcom basically made the survival horror genre a force to be reckoned with (while borrowing heavily from the original PC game Alone in the Dark) thanks to the original Resident Evil on the PS1, and now the game that spawned an entire series and countless immitators makes it's mark on Nintendo's DS, and also marks the first Mature rated game for the dual screened handheld to boot.  Now, let's get it straight that this is pretty much a direct port of the original PS1 classic (along with the unedited ""director's cut"" opening FMV sequence), and sadly the game hasn't aged all that well.  Everything bad you remember about the game is still here; from the unbelievably bad voice acting and dialogue, to go along with the incredibly cheesy FMV sequences.  Not to mention that the controls, which were annoying enough when you first played the game a decade ago, are now just plain archaic, especially on the DS.  However, after a while, you can get used to the control scheme, although prepare for bouts of frustration.  Not to mention that the graphics look granier here than one may recall, particularly the character and zombie models which look washed out.  Besides all the negatives, if you've played the PS1 game at all, then you know what else to expect here: playing as either Chris or Jill in different branching single player modes as you take on zombies, mutated dogs, and other beasts in a huge mansion.  There's doors to unlock and puzzles to solve to progress to your inevitable showdown with the Tyrant, which still manages to pack a punch to this day.  For all it's negatives, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence still has a bit of nostalgic charm to it that makes it worth playing, and the bonuses which Capcom has thrown in (including a first person perspective using your trusty knife and some additional touch screen and microphone features) make the game worth checking out even for veterans of the long running and influential series.  Whether you want to lay down the full price for it though is entirely up to how much nostalgia you can take in before longing to play the much superior Resident Evil 4 on your console.","A mixed bag, but still holds some nostalgic fun",1169510400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,True,"01 30, 2010",A18U9BQQQ0U8F5,B000VRH6Y0,Grieger,"There are probably two types of people out there interested in this game: people who've played one of the 18 Wheels series and people who haven't.

If you have played on of these games, skip down a bit.

If you haven't, depending on what sort of simulations you're in to, this game may give you hours of enjoyment or boredom.

The basic tack of the game is, as you'd expect, you get some money, an entry-level rig and a lack of any reputation. Your goal is to grab loads to haul and drive them across the US and to some extent Canada and Mexico. As you haul loads, you'll make more money for upgrades for your rig (or a whole new rig) and you'll gain a reputation. Your success and your reputation lead to your ability to hire on other drivers and expand your trucking empire.

To counteract your success, you'll have to deal with long (and in some cases boring) hauls, police (checking speed, general driving rules, etc), and to some extent, the competition of your fellow truckers. There's also traffic on the roads including other trucks. There used to be a bug in older versions that made traffic hazardous (cars would just randomly hit the brakes like they were trying to cause an accident) but that's gone and traffic will even yield to your turn signal. But, to compensate for this, the devs decided to throw in something else to cause you grief. If you so much as stop one inch beyond the line at a stop light, you'll be flagged as having run a red light (a fine worth up to $9000 in the game!). This and people driving in obvious violation of the law (well, at least in the states I've driven) where they're making right turns across one or more lanes of traffic (thus colliding with you and getting you in trouble with the law again) can mean you'll be dishing out a lot to pay violations. Of course, the silver lining is that you only really pay for violations if you pass within a certain distance of a parked cop car.

The graphics are passable but dated. The graphic engine won't show up on a video games award show any time soon. Cities will have some hints at their landmarks and the like but there is no real attempt to map out the city in anyway. The cities are just small hubs where you'll find services and companies to grab loads from. That said, it does what it needs to do and the rigs themselves are pretty detailed. There are several cameras you can use to check your rig out while driving plus a great top-down cam that's been in the games of the series for a while and for good reason...nothing beats using that to hitch and line up trailers. Even so, the camera can be limited (you can only zoom out so far) and with a long enough (double) trailer, you can't really see beyond about half way down the second trailer. You'll have to rely on mirrors and other camera angles to get that right.

The driving is okay but has the same limitations as any other driving game. Ideally, you'll want to use a wheel or joystick (or gamepad). I don't have any of those so I used the keyboard. The keyboard works but driving can be challenging at times given the lack of a way to ""finesse"" turns and the like. Even so, you'll largely just be more worried about getting from point A to point B. There are short cuts in places but you're largely constricted to a couple of set highways to get from city to city. Still, you've got to manage your speed (cops), your fuel (only so many gas stations), and your route (watch for those short cuts) so there are things to keep you busy even on a long haul.

Overall, the game can be fun but it's a very specific fun. I personally like business sims and love the idea of running and managing logistics and just trucking loads across America. If you're looking for a fast-paced game or a complicated economic sim, this is not the game for you. But, if you wanted to strap yourself into a rig and drive around the country hauling loads, this is the game for you. And, it also helps that the price is nice and low. This version essentially rolls up all the various updates and changes made throughout the 18 Wheels series so you're getting the best version of the simulation (with the business side as well as the rigs and some of the bug fixes).

Previous 18 Wheels Owners (Start here)

For those of you that have tried an 18 Wheels game before you should know the drill by now. The games are more of a minor evolution than a revolution as you go from game to game. At this point, though, in the series, you're getting all the enhancements that have come down the pike (the more complicated business sim, the fix for the traffic issue, the expanded map with all of North America, etc.). At the same time, if you got Haulin', you likely got most of this anyway.

So, if you haven't updated your original 18 Wheels (across america?) game, you should probably just grab this sucker (it's nice and cheap anyway) and get up to date.

If you got Haulin or are like me and got every version in the series so far, this isn't going to be pushing the envelope for you at all. Still, the map seems to be a bit different and I noticed at least one thing that was fixed (that traffic bug...where cars used to just hit the brakes all the time) and, as I mentioned, it's dirt cheap (at least right now @9.99), it might be worth the pick up just to get some of those minor enhancements. It's your money so you'll know the best approach.

All in all, I like the series despite it's issues. I, like a lot of other fans, keep holding out for that graphics upgrade and some more sophisticated aspects to the business part (and maybe an autopilot for those times when you really just don't want to do that cross-country run again).

I wasn't expecting much due to some pretty negative reviews trashing the repetitive gameplay and ho-hum graphics. So I was surprised when I popped it in and after playing for a little bit discovered I was actually having a lot of fun.
The game mainly involves piloting various modes of transport -- a hover tank, an aerial gunship, a speeder, even a two-legged beast of some sort -- and blasting any enemies that get in your way. It is fast-paced but satisfying to watch your targeting reticle bob around the screen before locking on to a soon-to-be doomed enemy and dispatching them will a volley of laser fire or perhaps a well-placed missile. There area also times when you will play a Jedi (Mace, Annakin, etc) on the ground. While these bits got slagged off by some gaming press, I found them to be pretty enjoyable. Your repertoire of tricks include throwing the light saber like a boomerang to take out far-away foes, doing acrobatic flips and jumps to avoid enemy fire, and taking out whole groups of evil goons with a blast of the Force from your outstretched hand.
The graphics are not eyepoppingly stunning, but they are solid and definitely convey the feeling of being in the Star Wars world. In the scenes where you fly the Jedi gunship, you can see scores of soldiers and droids blasting it below you, giving you the sense that you are part of a larger battle. I'm not a die-hard SW fan, but I did grow up on the movies and find the game does a decent job of filling in some of the events following the end of the ""Attack of the Clones"" movie.
Initially I was going to give this game four stars, but I gave games like ""Halo"" and ""Project Gotham Racing"" four stars, and this game, while fun, honestly isn't on the same level as those heavyweights. So it only gets three stars, but don't let that stop you from just having a good time in the Clone Wars.",Low expectations lead to a pretty fun time,1075852800,32,,

 Umbrella Chronicals is real close to what I want in a arcade shooter. Slow paced exploration of haunting mansions, plenty of weapon selections, (rpgs + zombies = fun), and ton of levels, great learning curve.

I thought we would be able to roll the biggest Katamari ever at lightning fast speeds, have 3 times as many areas to explore, a killer new soundtrack and tons of online playability. Unfortunately, Katamari fails to deliver on several of these expectations.

First, this game, like the other Katamari games:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Katamari-Damacy/dp/B0002Y2XXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Katamari Damacy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Love-Katamari/dp/B000A5K5MI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Love Katamari</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Me-and-My-Katamari/dp/B000BLFE9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Me and My Katamari</a>, is a BLAST to play. For those who don't know, you play as the Prince of the Cosmos who has been sent by the King of the Cosmos to use a sticky ball known as a Katamari, to roll up items in the world to create stars, satellites and planets to re-populate the solar system after the King has done something to mess up the galaxy (always something funny). The Katamari starts out small and at first you can only roll up small objects, but as the game progress you'll be able to roll up people, cars, buildings and even landmasses (and much later... entire planets!). This kind of unique gameplay is addictive and fun to say the least. Here's where the game falls short...

I defeated the game in a day and a half (that includes obtaining the online achievements). The game is very short compared to other Katamari releases. Also, you end up re-visiting several maps that are being passed off as new levels simply because they have a few different items in them. With the 360's power, I really expected there to be tons of levels and none that repeated themselves, which isn't the case here.

The sound was a let down also. Most of the sounds are recycled from old Katamari games and the soundtrack is the weakest in the series. The Katamari games are none for their killer soundtracks:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minna-Daisuki-Katamari-Damacy/dp/B0009OLPG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minna Daisuki Katamari Damacy</a>, but there are only 2 or 3 good songs that stand out. They even seemed to run out of new songs worthy of the game, because you'll also hear cuts from ""We Love Katamari"".

The online portion of the game is the biggest letdown. You can play thru all 5 levels in under 20 minutes and the object of each stage is to collect as many of a specific item as possible before the game ends. Online opponents can run into each other, knocking their foes items off their Katamari, but all this gets boring and repetative... after you play all the stages. I was really hoping for an online competition, where cousins could compete to roll the biggest Katamari for the King in either an online version of the one player game, or a specific game for xbox live, but it didn't happen.

With that said, there is a lot to praise. The game looks amazing in HD. I disagree with some gaming critics who think the graphics should have been redone to take advantage of the 360's power, but to me, if you change the look...it's not Katamari. In this version, the items and characters pop with a vibrant colorfully clarity you don't get in previous games. I also got one of my wishes for the game, you will be able to roll the biggest Katamaris ever! I won't give anything away, but the last stage is absolutely amazing. The replay value is very high with the game too. To trully beat a stage, you need to find all the cousins and presents and be awarded 100 points by the King. Obtaining 100 points on a stage, will unlock an infinite mode, that lets you play that stage without being timed! Just press ""X"" to quit. This is a great way to locate presents and cousins you may have missed, as well as plot a strategy to grow your Katamari at a faster rate, when it does matter.

Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. Die-hard fans of the series will love this version of Katamari, but I think you'll feel like the game could've been so much more.",Short and sweet,1192752000,64,,

The game itself feels pretty mediocre and i don't mean this because I hate the series or anything like that, quite the opposite i'm a new but huge Dragon Quest fan but this game is mostly a let down.

To start most of the story is basically the monsters have gone evil, and now you must go from area to area beating them up. I guess this wouldn't be much of an issue if there was something more to that or some interesting dialogue or something but there really isn't....Most of the characters just end up saying the same things from time to time and their voices end up getting annoying in the heat of battle.

Gameplay wise it's as much as you expect from a Dynasty Warrior type game, but it's a little watered down compared to something like Hyrule Warriors which seemed to have a bit more freedom with the characters. None of the attacks really feel all that impact and while the game is full of Dragon Quest HD charm the gameplay kinda fails to live up to what I expected.

For example, the two main characters are basically the same character gameplay wise, the male is fire while the female is ice, while I can see how this makes sense making sure one person doesn't feel let down by choosing one or the other it would've added to the replayability to have them play so differently that you want to go back and try as the other...but then again you can switch between them at anytime so I guess that idea is out the window.

Graphics wise the game is beautiful, it's nice to see all the monsters you've grown to known and love in HD really even if the most they do are basic attacks and what not. The arenas you fight in are honestly a bit simplistic and bland yeah they're pretty nice looking but you can't really go many places in them.

Music wise it's pretty well done but nothing spectacular outside of the Dragon Quest victory fanfare.

Overall the game seemed like a bit of a let down, I was expecting something more meatier and some co op even but I guess this was just a cash in on Square Enix's part.

Where to even begin with the messy, mixed bag that is `ALIENS vs. PREDATOR' (AvP)? ......I guess I'll start by giving some thoughts on the game overall and then break it down by each campaign in the order I played them. Bear with me, because this is going to be a long review. Partly because of how I review things, partly because this is like reviewing 3 separate games. Please keep in mind a few things : 1) I am a HUGE fan of both the Aliens and Predator movies (well, the good ones at least!), with `Alien' being my favorite movie of all time. 2) I played through each campaign on hard mode, so I fully realize some of the beefs I have may be due to difficulty level. 3) Despite the MANY issues I had with the game, I did enjoy it overall. See #1??

The Game In General
THE GOOD : A fair amount. First off, the simple fact that you can play as either a marine, a predator, or an alien is very cool. It's nice to be able to step into the 2 iconic monsters' skins and see the world through their eyes. Additionally, the settings and environments for each level all look very good and are different enough from each other so that it doesn't make them all monotonous. Even though you play through each of these levels in each campaign, you experience them from different perspectives and methods of moving around which also helps keep things fairly fresh. Normally I don't pay too terribly much attention to the story in a video game because I'm not playing a game for the literary value. If a story is horrendously bad, it won't stop me one bit from enjoying the heck out of a game (see `BAYONETTA' which possibly has the worst story ever, but is also my favorite game ever). However in the case of AvP, the story was actually quite good and when seen from the 3 different perspectives, it's even better. As well, all of the sounds, weapons and even `ol Carl Bishop Weyland himself (voiced by the actor from the movies, Lance Henriksen - definitely a nice touch!) are straight out of the movies. And all of the weapons, ammo and health are scattered about appropriately enough so you never really run out, but at the same time, you have to be careful to conserve your resources. Another point of interest that I realize some might find irritating, but I found refreshing, was the sense of realism when it came to `special interactions', as I call them. For instance, when you harvest a civilian as an alien, reload as a marine or recharge your weapons as a predator, you're still very vulnerable to attack and can even die during these brief interludes. There are other examples in each campaign, but many of the games I've played give you a bit of an `invulnerability window' while doing things like this. Not AvP. Sure, it ticked me off every now and then, but in hindsight, I actually respect this design choice. It just makes logical sense. As one last thought for the good in general about this game, in addition to the 3 different campaigns, you can also play a survivor mode where you're a lone marine fighting off ever-increasing waves of aliens and there's also various online modes to play as well. In fact, it's the online modes that are really the strong point of this game. They're a blast to play and it's especially fun considering, again, you can be and be facing off against 3 different species.

THE BAD : Also a fair amount here, too. The biggest glaring weakness is the entire Alien campaign, but we'll deal with that soon enough. Otherwise I'd have to say the controls are for crap. I played this game after playing a few other first person shooters (RESISTANCE 2 for instance) and AvP was a stark contrast against them in terms of ease of control. To be fair, I don't know how else I would have done it because there's a lot to take into consideration across 3 different species (although the marine and predator are similar), but I still found it problematic. As I mentioned above, all of the weapons and sound effects seen in the movies also appear in the game, but there were a few things I found myself asking ""was this really necessary?"" For instance, were androids REALLY necessary in this game? Wouldn't human stoolies for the company have been just as purposeful without cramming these artificial soldiers in? And I don't recall ever using the Predator's mines other than just to see how they worked. Plus, his heat visor was absolutely useless (though cool) except in one or two spots. As for the sound effects, it was absolutely laughable (and grating) to hear the marines utter pretty much only 3 different sentences throughout the campaigns, unless there was a specific programmed conversation or line relating directly to what you were doing. Something else that was laughable was the AI. It was astoundingly bad. You could literally kill a marine standing right next to another marine and they just might not notice! And talk about stupid - some of the characters would actually run and hide in a corner with their faces in their hands, if you approached them! I mean, really!?!? It was almost refreshing when some of them chose suicide over whatever you had in store for them. Tacking right on to the blisteringly dumb AI, was also a severe lack of logic on things. For instance, why can the predator jump 20-30 feet in some areas but not 2 feet in others?? Why do marines and others go TOWARDS the sound of an alien hissing? There were many other things like this throughout each campaign but I'll leave it to you to discover them. Something else that should be noted, though I don't know whether it was a good or bad thing, is each of the campaigns is relatively short, with each having only about 5 or 6 different levels and each level taking about an hour or more to play, depending on your skill level. As one last thought for this `bad' section, (and I realize this depends on your gaming style) the PS3 trophies / Xbox achievements can be VERY tough to complete 100%. The lack of checkpoints in Nightmare difficulty and a few of the online trophies (anyone who has read my other reviews knows I hate online trophies) can make this a really difficult game to get a Platinum Trophy or 100% completion on. Just something to consider if that's your thing....

Now for the individual campaigns.....

The Marine Campaign
THE GOOD : This was overall the best of the 3 campaigns and the one you really should start off with. The familiarity of a `human' FPS is a nice way to ease into the game and the first 2 levels, especially, contain some genuinely creepy moments that will make you feel like you're watching the better of the `Aliens' movies. All of the weapons are fun to use (especially the smart-gun) and each has their place in the story. Even the motion tracker with it's constant clicking and pinging added to the atmosphere, even though I know may others just found it annoying. I guess, for me, what made this the best campaign was the ratio of good versus bad in the campaign. It's just not as pronounced as it is in the others. All in all, it's a pretty standard FPS that has some great moments and a few under-whelming ones...

THE BAD : Unfortunately, like all the other campaigns in the game, the marine campaign has its' problems. Beyond some of the general problems with the game that I've already mentioned, and that apply here, the most glaring problem with this FPS campaign was..... the shooting. Your main weapon tends to be the pulse rifle. And its' sight / target is not easily visible like some of the other weapons are and it requires absolute pinpoint accuracy. All in all not bad if you're going for realism, but try shooting an alien as it jumps from floor, to wall, to ceiling, to wall, to floor, to wall, to.....well, you get the idea. Not exactly easy. Now try it with a swarm of them! And for all the good the bullets seem to do against either the aliens or the predators, you may as well be shooting rock salt. It's not that they don't die eventually but you'd certainly expect them to die a little faster against a rapid-fire barrage of hot metal. Good thing there's a `wash-rinse-repeat' tactic that works fairly well against them:  hit `em to knock `em backwards and shoot `em. Too bad this needs to be used as much as it does - it just makes it unnecessarily repetitive.

The Alien Campaign
THE GOOD : Barely anything. Seriously. Other than being able to control (if you really can call it that) this iconic creature, there just isn't much good here. I suppose it's kind of cool to be able to walk on any surface and through vents, etc., but that in and of itself becomes a problem, which we'll deal with shortly. It was fairly fun to play this campaign because it's definitely something different from both a standard FPS and from the other 2 campaigns in the game, but there was so much frustration involved here, it just sucked a lot of the fun right out of it. It was nice though to be able to absolutely haul @$$ when needed because the marine and predator, even at a sprint, aren't anywhere close to as fast as the alien at a sprint. It's just too bad you'll need to retreat from danger as much as you will. This is supposedly a pretty tough critter, right? At least that's the way the movies make it look. The game has other ideas. Then again, the alien, is a big space insect, so maybe its' strength is really it's numbers?? ...One last good thing about the alien campaign is the `finishing moves'. They are brutal, bloody and just what they should be. Whether it's harvesting a human by putting a face-hugger on them, spearing your tail through their chest or mouth, or giving their cranium the `ol run-through w/ your second set of jaws, the aliens finishers are quite satisfying indeed. At least they got something right here.

THE BAD : Oh, so much. So much so, it made me wonder why they even had this campaign in the game other than they had to, because, well, it's AvP. The most glaring problem with the alien campaign is the controls and the aliens' inability to transition to surfaces as smoothly as it should. The alien can move pretty fast, as I've previously mentioned, so it's downright dizzying crawling all over the place 360 degrees and discombobulating being upside down. So when the alien doesn't transition to surfaces as smoothly as it should, it makes for a genuinely frustrating experience. The aliens' target / crosshairs / whatever, which is shaped like a teeny, tiny `T' is supposed to help you keep track of what's up and what's down, but it `s so small and, again, things can move so fast, it's not easy to tell what's what sometimes. All in all, I found myself staying on the ground as much as possible, to make things easier. Kind of defeats the purpose of being the alien, doesn't it? Another glaring weakness of this campaign was the aliens' attack strength. I know that a game can't make things TOO easy, but for one of the most fearsome creatures in the galaxy, as another reviewer elsewhere said, ""you may as well be tickling your enemies"". It's noteworthy that the same applies to the predator, but it's funny that this isn't the case when you're playing the other creature's campaign. That is to say, as the alien it's damn tough to take down the predators, but when you're a predator, the aliens can take you down rather easily. And the same applies in reverse. This just gets back to my `lack of logic' beef I mentioned in the `general' section. Also, as I mentioned in the previous section, the finishing moves are quite satisfying and rather brutal, but there was one in particular I couldn't help snickering at each time I saw it. It involved the alien grabbing a marine and then gently caressing their face with its' tail before lopping their head off. Bloody and vicious to be sure, but, just seemed .... odd.... considering the other finishers. Anyway, enough of the bad w/ this campaign. Suffice it to say, I hope those of you who play this particular campaign end up liking it better than I did (though I did enjoy it in small doses),  but overall this is just downright abysmal.

The Predator Campaign
THE GOOD : A decent bit actually. If the marine campaign was the best overall, this one was definitely the most interesting. The first thing that impressed me was the predator's visor. Not the heat vision (which as I've already noted was basically useless for the most part), but the way in which it highlighted all the items of interest in your surrounding environment. This made it much easier to form strategies in terms of where health or weapons could be recharged and what path you'd need to take to get there. It also allowed you to see where you could or couldn't jump and highlighted the collectibles. A rather handy tool all the way around! In addition to the visor, the various weapons were all fun and easy to use, plus their controls all made sense. Another thing about the predator campaign that made it fun was the blend of approach it took. By that, I mean it had elements of the marines' run-and-gun approach and elements of the aliens' stealth approach and it was balanced rather well. It was also quite cool, at lest from a story perspective, to see a little bit more about the predator's `hunter' culture. Though this mainly played out in cut scenes, it was also prevalent in some of the scenery and things you interface with. Speaking of the scenery, while it was possible and at times necessary in the alien campaign to view it from above, the predator did so without making you wish you were back on the ground. From this perspective it was nice to see the previously played levels from the treetops and rooftops and added a whole new dimension to the action. As I mentioned in the few good spots for the alien campaign, the predator campaign also has some devastating, bloody and wicked finishing moves. Beyond just plunging your blades through a marines' chest, you could also rip their head off, pulling their spine out with it. Easily the best finishing move in the whole game!

THE BAD : Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to predator campaign to be the best in the game, it just wasn't. Partly because of some of the things I mentioned in general, like the game's bad logic when it came to where the predator could or couldn't jump, but partly because of where it strayed from the movies when this game did everything it could to incorporate as much from the movies as it could. For instance, anything you do other than jumping while you're cloaked, caused you to un-cloak. Want to use the plasma caster? It causes you to drop your camouflage. Want to attack someone with your blades or throw the battle disc or spear? Same thing here. And as anyone who's seen the movies knows, this wasn't the case in the cinematic presentations. In fact, that was partly what helped make the predator such a lethal and fearsome ..... predator. If the game really wanted to put you at a disadvantage while cloaked but keep its' continuity with the movies, why not un-cloak just the blades when extended (which is always)? I guess what I'm getting at (and this applies to all the campaigns) is, for a game that strived so hard to stay true to and incorporate as much of the movies as it could, why such glaring inconsistencies? Another inconsistency that just made me go ""HUH??"" was that while you could finish a marine off by plunging your blades through their chest via the finishing move, why is it that it took many numerous swipes of your blades at close range to do so in melee combat? Just made no sense whatsoever. Overall this is a pretty good campaign, but it's not without some significant and glaring weaknesses.

THE BOTTOM LINE : This is a game that I dearly wanted to love. I truly did. I was even trying to be forgiving about it after some of the horrendous reviews I'd read. But despite that, the game has some significant and glaring issues with it, and the alien campaign itself drags the overall rating of this game down a notch or two on its' own. I found myself screaming at the screen a good number of times and was quite ready to be done with the game after a while, which I don't usually experience. Still, the game has some redeeming points and is overall a good bit of fun to play. Especially if you're a serious fan of the respective franchises, as I am. The online mode is a lot of fun and the single-player campaigns make for some good variety. Buy at a discount if this kind of thing is for you otherwise rent it. Just don't pay full price for this - at $40-$60 it's a rip-off.

UPON FURTHER REVIEW..... : From time to time I'll come back to my reviews and re-read them and re-play the game a bit, just to make sure I didn't leave anything out or see if there's anything I want to revise. In the case of AvP, I guess I have to say that despite my criticisms, the undeniable fact that this game is flawed in a good many ways, and the sheer amount of frustration I experienced with aspects of the game (Nightmare Marine Mode & some of the online trophies, anyone?), I actually enjoyed this game A LOT! I really did. And as blasphemous as this probably is to say, I liked this game better than 'Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2' (which, incidentally I played right after AvP). But I guess that just goes to show there's no accounting for taste, right? In looking back, I found this game to be VERY challenging and just a ton of fun. Even the Alien campaign I sandblasted in my review, I enjoyed a lot more when I went back and played it in Nightmare mode. Maybe it's because I knew what to expect? Maybe it's because I had my expectations already properly adjusted to be low? Who knows? But I can definitely say, that out of all the shooters I own (including Dead Space, Resistance 1 & 2, COD : MW2) AvP is my favorite. Go figure......So I'm bumping up the rating I gave it, because, ultimately, a videogame is measured not on it's technical or aesthetic merits, but on how much FUN you have with it. And again, after all was said and done, I really enjoyed the hell out of this game despite all it's flaws.",A fun but VERY mixed-bag of tricks,1277078400,44,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

We are given the excuse that since they can walk they can get over obstacles and thus they are better than tanks, yet the only terrain we EVER see them on is a colloection of WIDE ROADS and OPEN FIELDS.

The fun part is just the ability to control your soldiers around your walking abomination of machinery(especially the old man's ""junk"" walking robot, like it's that easy to slap one together).

Unfortunately, this Kirby game isn't like the previously mentioned title. ""The Amazing Mirror"" was definitely designed with four player co-op in mind. If you're like me and are enjoying these GBA titles in 2015, you're probably not gonna find anyone who has a GBA and ""Amazing Mirror"" to join you on your quest. Let's talk about the single player campaign. Its the same as the co-op campaign except you're playing by yourself with 3 other A.I. Kirbys. ""Amazing Mirror"" is not linear like ""Nightmare"". In fact, its quite the opposite. Your goal is to find the 8 shards of the amazing mirror. You'll start at your central hub which begins with one door. As you progress you will unlock more doors which act as shortcuts to the central hub. While you are in the different areas of the game, it can get quite confusing, which leads to ""Amazing Mirror""s downfall. The map, assuming you have found it (think Zelda's dungeons) will show you where you have been, where you're going, and where the boss is who has one of the shards you need. You can easily skip a boss or two and get the shards in any order you wish. Problem is, most of the time you stumble on to the next area, instead of the boos or map you were looking for. That's my biggest problem with this game. SO MANY DOORS! Too many paths to take! Seriously, each square of the map you are in may have 3 different doors which is 3 different paths. What I cannot stand in this Kirby game is there are MANY dead ends. If you stumble into a dead end you are screwed. You must take a warp star back to the central hub. Now had you not found the door which takes you to the hub as a shortcut, you are gonna be doing a lot of backtracking. The map looks like a freaking tree with a the path choices you have. Yeah, its ugly. Your A.I. Kirby partners are no where to be seen unless you summon them on your cell phone. That's right, Kirby got himself a cell. On to the brighter side of things, the power ups are much cooler than in ""Nightmare"". You have the basics, spark, laser, hammer, etc. However they have added some new ablilties as well. You now have ""cook"" which functions exactly like Kirby's final smash in Super Smash Bros Brawl. You have ""smash"" which functions like Kirby plays in the Smash Bros series. They tweaked a couple existing abilities as well. For instance, ""fight"" now functions like actually fighting. Gone are the ways of sucking people up and body slamming them. Now, when you have ""fight"" you will punch and kick in a fury of blows. So I would have to say that while I enjoy ""Amazing Mirror"", its just too confusing to progress and very frustrating when you cant get to where you need to go. It is still a Kirby game and still fun to play when you're on the right track.

2. Voice acting is repetitive and annoying. Somewhere around the fifth time you hear a Psyker cackle or a ""Chaos, chaos is good"" announcement you're going to turn off the sound.......if you haven't clawed your ears off already...........

3. There aren't enough single player maps. The few supplied with the game are good, the downloadable community map packs are better but there are only three map packs that work. Many of the download packs don't install or there's some trick to it I'm not getting.

Its evolution is in the design. Graphics are amazing, and most of the environments are so compelling you feel absolutely absorbed by the game...

UNTIL you realize that the combat is so super weak you feel like you beat this game in your sleep. I'm a very casual gamer, and it felt like it required no effort at all to plow through this game on the regular difficulty. I guess you could bump it up to hard, but that wouldn't change the other problem with the combat, which is that the mechanics feel totally outdated. For example, in previous tomb raiders you could do really basic things like shoot while jumping, but not in this one. You just aim boring weapons at super slow moving targets and shoot them from pretty much any range, and that's how you whack mofos. The weapons are kind of like whatever  who really cares about upgrading your rifle since it basically kills everything effortlessly from any distance and you never really run out of ammo. Lastly, there's times where the game feels like some old crappy arcade game, where you have to tap ""X"" at just the right moment to get through a sequence. I saw that in this game and I was like, really, people still incorporate this into video games... why? No, really, why??

It's all good though. I bought this on Black Friday discount and it was a fun game, even though I plowed through it super fast. I guess there's a bunch of secret tombs you can find here and there, and secret items like relics (like little carved statues, which no sane person would ever really care about)... if any of that floats your boat. I was really impressed by every aspect of the game's design, but found the combat to be whatever.

The game is a major success, but I think some designers will continue to learn the wrong lessons from that success. It's a success because the game's graphical engine creates a remarkably engaging sense of being a part of the Star Wars universe--something that many of us crave. It uses music and visuals perfectly to this end. The core storyline is engaging enough: Kyle Katarn is a likeable, believable protagonist, and the game makes use of other Star Wars story elements very well. So on one hand, the game works very hard to achieve immersion.
On the other hand, the game's level design makes it almost impossible to achieve immersion. When travelling through a level, you are not Kyle Katarn: you're just a guy sitting in front of your terminal trying to figure out what the game designer wants you to do next. Puzzles are not intuitive, and the solution is usually a rigid, artificial and sometimes nonsensical sequence of actions. You have to run a gauntlet of enemies who have somehow positioned themselves in places that your own character could not get to--in many cases, places which are actively impossible for any living creature to have travelled to given the design of the level. At one point, you have to protect a droid from a host of enemies while also disarming trip mines. You can push the droid back using your Force powers, but only so far: push him back far enough and he spontaneously explodes. Why? Because the designer wants you to beat the level the way he wants you to beat it.
It doesn't have to be this way. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault has demonstrated that an FPS can have good, immersive level design without having to resort to this kind of straightjacket.
JK2's multiplayer is decent enough, but it becomes boring fairly quickly. When force powers are enabled, the game is dominated by the boring over-use of force push and force choke. When weapons other than lightsabers are enabled, snipers and explosive weapons rule the day, but in no more interesting a fashion than any other multiplayer FPS on the market.","The Best of Times, the Worst of Times",1036886400,8,,

Graphics: 8/10. The cars look great, and when you're using turbo the blur looks good, and the destruction looks good, but there are occasional slowdowns in framerate when there is a lot going on. There are better looking 360 games out there.

Sound: 7.5/10. The cars and crashes sound good, but the music is pretty annoying and there is nothing above average about any of the sound in Full Auto.

Control: 7.5/10. It's kind of hard to control this game, especially on 1 player. You have to concentrate on when to get ready to emergency brake into a turn, aim your weapons, shoot your weapons, when to use your turbo, where there are mines on the road, and more. After awhile, you'll get used to it, though.

Fun: 7.5/10. Overall, Full Auto could be better. It's career mode leaves something to be desired; it's extremely short. It will take you no more than 8 hours to beat the game, and it really is for the most part to get gold medals. This game is for people of any age to beat; it's that easy. You'll have all the cars ( except one ) after playing 40% through career mode. Multiplayer is fun, but there is no ""rewind"" mode, so it seems like a different game.

But I finished the game with trying to do and get just about everything in about 7 hours. Luckily I only paid about 1/2 the sticker price on Ebay.

The graphics and elements like the skyline were great. Although overall the visuals were much more close to Dishonored than previous Bioshock games. The game started out more like Bioshock just with the way you collect supplies, health, and the feel of combat & the historical feel of the originals. But once Elizabeth came on the scene, the game really changed. Granted, it was nice to have someone tossing me health and elixir, but it wasn't the same feel as Bioshock.

Despite other reviews, there still are a few moral choices, mainly dealing with racial issues. I don't mind a game examining racial topics, but it didn't feel like the real focus of the game and some of it portrayed very stereotyped images. The ending as many have said really does not flow with the game and is some 1/2 attempt at something more existential, etc.

Overall this has been a disappointing year with franchises really jumping the shark to make a buck on rather lame games. Assassin's Creed 3, Tomb Raider, Hitman Absolution and now Bioshock all really missed the mark concerning the good things about each series. When a game changes so much, they really just need to call & package it as a new game.

The one game that did make the grade this year was the previously mentioned Dishonored. It lived up to the advertising hype, and I find it quite replayable, and they've just released a nice DLC called ""The Knife of Dunwall"".

3.0,False,"10 21, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00113JSCG,Lisa Shea,"Despite being a successor to the early 90s horror series Alone in the Dark, the new Alone in the Dark game is only partially related to those old games. It has its own merits, and its own shortcomings, but does not seem particularly related to previous games and must be considered more as a stand-alone game.

The story of the game involves a doomsday cult trying to summon an ancient evil using Edward Carnby, the private detective and protagonist from Alone in the Dark (the original), who has been brought to the present by unknown means and has amnesia. At first, the evil presence (marked by glowing cracks in walls that move and seek out prey as if alive) is limited to a single building, but it quickly spreads throughout the entirety of New York City, leaving Edward trapped in Central Park.

As far as stories go, this is a decent one for a survival horror game, and there are a lot of good scares and surprises. In the beginning, you're trapped in a building where the very walls are trying to get you, and in addition you're also dealing with zombies - people swallowed up by the cracks brought back as malicious outlets for the main demon to speak and act through. The main demon's voice is kind of bad, though - it's the same deep monster voice that has basically become a cliche in movies about demons, and it makes the glowing cracks go from ""unidentified, unintelligent, but malicious entity"" to ""scary-voiced demon guy"". In fact, as far as scares go, the main problem with Alone in the Dark is that you're so rarely alone. Besides the short-lived survivors you encounter throughout the game, you also have a sidekick, Sarah, who comes and goes throughout parts of the game. Well, ""sidekick"" is a bit generous, since there's not a lot of cooperative gameplay involved. But the point is that there's no feeling of isolation; it's more like a disaster movie that happens to have monsters in it.

The standard gameplay is a fairly regular survival-horror control system. The game is normally played in third-person, with somewhat awkward tank-style controls (IE you have to walk, then turn, then walk, rather then just turning while you walk). The camera in particular is hard to manage, and trying to look around while moving or anything besides walking in a straight line was pretty difficult to manage. Aiming firearms is done exclusively in first-person, but melee combat has a bit of a unique twist to it - it's done in third person like normal gameplay segments, and swinging melee weapons is done by ""swinging"" the right thumbstick from one direction to another. This works pretty well in most cases, and it changes depending on the weapon being used. For example, with long weapons like 2x4s or swords, you only have the option to swing horizontally or vertically. However, with heavier items like fire extinguishers, you can also use the item as a battering ram to smash down doors.

Most of the enemies in the game can only be temporarily defeated by weapons, and must be consumed by fire to be fully destroyed. To this end, innovating ways to use fire as a weapon is one of the most important parts of the game. The most basic form of this is to light a melee weapon on fire by sticking it into the flames; the flames don't last forever, but they're an instant-kill to most of the monsters that you'll face, and the enemy cowers and flees accordingly. In fact, I would say that swinging a burning 2x4 while your formerly aggressive zombie enemies cower and flee before you is probably the most satisfying part of the game. There are other methods as well that must be thought up with more open thinking - things like molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers made out of a can of hair spray and a match. While the ""make weapons out of things to defeat your foes"" aspect is pretty much limited to fire, the fact that fire is what destroys your enemies makes it at least plausible.

Your inventory in the game is represented by the holsters and pouches in your jacket. The left side of your jacket is used for small items like boxes of ammo or batteries, there's a holster for a gun and a flashlight on your chest, and the right side is used for bottles and cans of various types. The fact that there's a legitimate, actual inventory (you actually look down in first-person to access it, and it's in real-time too so you have to hurry and put stuff together instead of just calmly making a molotov cocktail during a pause) helps with the atmosphere that's being created. In a similar manner, wounds show up on your body and must be healed with either bandages or a first-aid spray. There's no health bar (as with the inventory, all HUD elements are minimal in this game), but you can get a general idea of how injured you are by the status of your wounds (which are still present after being healed, but aren't red and open). You also get a phone/PDA at a point in the game that allows you to make calls and gives you access to a GPS map of the area you are in.

In many situations it's necessary to hotwire a car or activate a fusebox (which is done in real time, often with monsters closing in on you) by picking the right wires to spark together. You're often frantically pressing wires together hoping that they're the right ones but doing it quickly enough to get away from the monsters closing in on your car. This is a pretty good part of the game in an atmospheric sense. Driving the car is another thing, though; the controls are wonky and in most cases the demands of the game as far as getting away from giant apocalyptic cracks in the road are a little bit over-the-top. I spent a good hour on what is really a five-minute segment where you're trying to get away from a giant series of cracking roads and earthquakes because the car didn't turn enough, or it turned too much, or I hit another motorist and the car got stuck, or I hit something at a bad angle. The last one in particular is annoying; at the end of the sequence in question, you're supposed to go flying out through a window in a building, but the first time I got there, I assumed that was what was supposed to happen, but I hit it at an odd angle and I didn't go through (I left a mark on the glass though). The next two times I made it there, I tried looking around for other exits but got blocked off. Only on the last time did I realize what had happened and just drive straight into the glass.

The graphics in the game are pretty good; the best graphics are the fire graphics, which flicker and dance pretty realistically, while the worst are probably the wounds that Edward receives on his body. The idea's neat, but in actuality they're just the same image copy-pasted onto different parts of his body. The ""slash that ripped through cloth and pierced the skin"" image looks okay when it's on his pants or shirt, but when it's on his jacket it just looks like someone slapped it on like a sticker. Also, you get the same kind of wound no matter how you got the injury. Overall, though, the graphics are decent and atmospheric.

The sound isn't bad, but the music just feels wrong. It's a nice attempt at atmospheric music, but most of the time it's not so much ""scary"" as it is ""epic"", with giant sweeping musical interludes and ominous chanting that fits more with ""Carmina Burana"" than a horror movie. It just feels overstated, and not particularly scary. Furthermore, it gets old pretty quickly, too.

As a whole, the worst part of Alone in the Dark is its execution. It has a lot of good ideas, and most of the elements taken by themselves are pretty sound. However, the actual execution of the ideas - the controls, the situation, the atmosphere - are all really terrible and frustrating, and the game seems more like a battle against the game itself than against any monsters or puzzles. The interactive environments seem more linear than natural; despite the fact that it's supposed to be stuff that's done in a manner that makes it seem ""realistic"", there's so many scripted sequences that it's hard to get into it.

As a whole, Alone in the Dark deserves a 6/10 - good ideas, but poor execution.",Good Ideas - Poor Execution,1224547200,4,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
3.0,False,"03 28, 2011",A1CKY01WDLN1DK,B0047TLIBU,M. Zveris,"I liked the second Dragon Age, it wasn't a bad game.  The lore was very nice, the tie in with the first game that cropped up regularly, was all very pleasant.  I was at first annoyed with the simplified dialog options however it was very helpful throughout the game and I did end up finding it useful.  The changes to the combat system were also welcome and made this Dragon Age all the more enjoyable.  I still ended up modifying all of my tactics and using the pause functions for more specific commands (I played through on Hard Mode first, where it is necessary).

Unfortunately despite the fact that the game was pleasant and I took my time to explore every nook and cranny throughout my first play-through (I am now on my third run-through of the game) I was left a little disappointed.  This game, despite the ending revealing it to be more, feels like a large downloadable content expansion I would buy for $24.99 as compared to a full price game if I compare it to its predecessor.

It has replay value, but not as much as the first game where you have so many options and origin stories that it becomes something near an addiction to try and discover every way to conquer the game.  My primary focus on replaying this game is not to experience anything different, as there's really not too terribly much you can change in the story, it's to finish off my trophy list.

While I enjoyed learning more about the Qunari and experiencing part of the Free Marches I wasn't terribly impressed with many aspects of the game (outlined in cons).  Much of my pleasure was derived from the mechanics changes from the first Dragon Age: the combat system, dialog options, class upgrades, et cetera.  It had little to do with the story that while engaging was not epic in the way the first Dragon Age managed to be.  There was no Blight or other major plot push; it was the story of a Ferelden refugee making a life in the Free Marches.  Yes the ending expands on what happened because of this, but it just felt like a lead up to another Dragon Age, not a resolution of the many issues you encounter in the game.

If you liked the first Dragon Age this game is worth purchasing, just don't expect it to be as rich and immersive as the original.  All in all it isn't a bad game, but it isn't great or even really all that good.  If it were something you downloaded or paid less for...say a max price point of $40 it would be fantastic.  At full price, it's really disappointing.

General Cons:

For the small area that you are exploring in this game it is very disappointing that there are five different maps for caves, they simply block off certain portions for a ""new cave"" which results in a very tired feeling of doing the same thing over and over.  I completely understand going to the same cave and finding the same map, but when new areas unlock due to side quests or chapter progression it seems lazy to just recycle a map and close a doorway.

There are points in the game where the graphics feel especially rushed, for example when you are first journeying to Kirkwall - the water looks terrible, as if it was rendered in MSPaint.  Compared with the rest of the game it looks awful and makes everything feel a little rushed.  Flame from torches at night is the same way; it looks cheap compared to the rich spell effects.

Bugs: (Mild Spoilers)

General:

The game has problems with freezing, especially when loading into large battles or after you go through a video sequence.  Having checked with friends playing on Xbox 360 and PS3 (like myself) their game freezes as well, causing you to completely reload your system in order to get out of the game.  This tapers off in Chapter 3, and seemed most prevalent around the battles with the Arishok in chapter 2.

Chapter 3 Specific Bugs:

Chapter three of the game is riddled with errors that really hurt the continuity of the game.  Your friendship quest with Merrill can end before it ever begins; talking to her at her house results in her holding a conversation that makes no sense (it gives you the ending dialogue of the quest).  Luckily if you speak with Allistar at the Keep it will allow you to go back to Merrill and begin her quest, going through to the conclusion, but you never get that ending dialogue again.

Unfortunately, that game requires the use of EITHER a thumb stick, r1, r2, L1, or L2 button. This is a problem because this game pad doesn't have these buttons as an option. If you have this a gamepad plugged in before turning on your console it will register as the first controller and so you will not be able to use A ps3 controller for the extra buttons you will need. However, if you plug it in after the first controller is on I found that I can hold on to the controller and use the buttons on it in addition to the dance pad buttons.  This is horribly inconvenient though, but with a move controller it might be easier.

When playing specifically with Dance Dance Revolution though, the buttons all work, but it is thrown off by the inclusion of a PS button at the top - which does not pause DDR.

Of course, the real problem with this game pad is the smell. Its giving me a headache just being near the thing. This is probably the strongest formaldehyde smell that I have ever smelled in a controller of all things. Even after putting it on a clothesline to air out, the house stinks of it. It would've been nice if the instructions said to air it out before plane, but it was hard enough to understand the bad English in the manual anyway. Seriously, do not use this thing until you have aired it out first. That much toxic fumes are dangerous to anyone.

On the plus side, since the controller works with any game, it will be interesting to see how classic RPGs play with the dance mat.","Works, but not for all dance games ( and the smell!)",1394755200,,,

3.0,False,"10 21, 2006",A7GXT5V1VL5UT,B000FZXHNM,J. Leigh,"This game feels liked a simplified X Men Legends game. That's not always a bad thing.

Unlike XMen you don't get to pick your team right away. You follow the storyline which picks your team of 2 people each time (at least initially). E.g. Supe and Batman; Flash and Green Lantern. You can choose who to control while playing and you can tell the computer-controlled AI to be either normal, passive or aggressive.

Attribute improvements are easier to manage than in X men which confronted you with so many different addons that you end up selling most of them anyway. In Justice League you gather orbs for luck, duration, efficiency, damage, etc that you can then apply to your powers or combine to form in groups of 3 to form more powerful power ups. The interface is intuitive and I managed to get through it without reading the manual. You can choose to use the powerups right away or just keep combining them till you have a super duper powerup.

You can unlock more powers using experience points gained by destroying the bad guys. Saving civilians gives you Justice league credits that you can then use to buy stuff like additional characters and costumes. You will have the option to choose the costumes and characters later in the game.

Overall the game gets repetitive pretty fast. It's not a particular fault of this game per-se, X-Men also got repetitive after a while.

But I have to admit, as you play this game longer and start powering up your heroes, the game does begin to grow on you. I think the fact that you have a core group of heroes that you level up helps make this game more intimate than X-Men because there are so many to choose from. This seemed to keep the game more connected with the story, whereas the 4 characters you play in X-Men may or may not appear in the cutscenes.

 So while the game feels like a 3/5 initially, I edged towards 4/5 at the end. I think compared to X-Men this game had more creative execution of powers. Here for e.g. are a few that make this game unique as compared to X-Men:

- Batman's batarang looks like any other projectile weapon initially, it does have the ability to disarm an enemy which is useful when everyone's carrying a gun.

- Batman also has the batswarm attack which lets you launch a swarm of bats against an enemy that will attack it for a significant duration. You literally fire and run away to let the bats take care of it. I have used this effectively against the first boss.

- Flash's pinball power lets you bounce between enemies and attack them very quickly.

- Green Lantern has this giant grinder power that you literally mow your enemy down with.

- Zatana turns enemies into bunny rabbits.

When the game is over you can restart the game from the beginning using all the accumulated stats so that you can continue to become more powerful. You will reach appoint that superman can become so powerful that he can just stand there and get beaten by the enemy without affecting his health bar at all- which is what superman's supposed to be like anyway!",Slow to start but grows on you.

I bought one 2 days ago, finally.  The first thing I noticed was how cheap the casing is on the console.  Second, the disc tray feels extremely flimsy and unstable.  Functionally, the dashboard interface is messy and loud (granted, they're fixing this issue with the new dashboard so we'll see what it's like).  The console seems to be optimized for 480i or 480p output and the HD portion of it feels like an afterthought.  The fact that after 3 years Microsoft has yet to include built-in WiFi is rather shocking.  Oh, and lest we forget the extremely LOUD whirr the DVD drive makes!

The only game I've played on it is Mass Effect.  While so far (and I'm only about 20 minutes in) it seems like it's gonna be the epic sci-fi RPG I've been dying to play, I'm disappointed by the graphics on it.  They just don't seem up to par.  I'm hoping that's only the limitations of the unimpressive Unreal engine, but while I hate to sound fanboyish, PS3 could do it better.

I'm happy with my purchase, seeing as I got the Arcade bundle at half price using a $100 gift card.  I like now owning all 3 current generation consoles and having no limitations on what games are available to me.

The game is not bad but you can tell it feels like a kiddie console port job. It has been dumbed down since the first Mass Effect to the point that levelling up almost seems pointless compared to the options you had in the first one. Then there are the kiddie console achievements....

They must think all gamers are 13 -16 year olds.

Overall so far pretty good but I wished I had waited for the price to come down first, not worth full price in my book because of the obvious port job simplicity to it, no good PC depth levelling up that it could have been if it were written for the PC first or if they bothered to add it into the PC version.

Multiplayer Matchmaking is far too simplistic and limited.

Players are robbed of choices that are essential to a great remaster like this game is pretending to be.

I personally hate Halo 4's multplayer, but I have no way of excluding myself from Halo 4 games.

My favorite multiplayer mode is big team battle, because it has 16 players, but the flawed matchmaking system first finds you teamates, and then lets them vote on the map. If the other players choose a Halo 4 map, the only way to get out of it is to quit and leave your teamates down a player.

Instead of being able to choose big team battle by game or by level, microsoft forces you to get stuck in one of 3 choices the game picks for you.

You can't just enter matchmaking for Halo big team battle, or Halo 2 BTB, or Halo 3 BTB, Your only option is to pick BTB for all the halo games.

You can't pick what map you want to play on either.

This is a problem because the game chooses the same maps over and over, and you've got no recourse to stop it.

It's the most oversimplified matchmaking you could possibly imagine for a remaster that includes 4 games.

I am exhausted of being offered the same maps to vote for over and over.

There should be 100 more matchmaking lobbies than they currently have. They've got literally 10% of what they should have.

Feel like playing Halo one big team battle? too bad, because blood gulch is the only map that you ever have a chance to vote for.

I am still waiting to play sidewinder. I could say that for dozens of maps I have wanted to play that the game never lets you vote on.

I am so tired of getting forced into playing Halo 4. I'm not an jerk, so I can't just ditch my teammates.

Also, you can't play small or medium sized maps in Big Team Battle. They just rip the choice from you. Ever wanted to see what a small or medium sized map plays like with 16 players? Too Bad.

Singleplayer : If you're like me, then you've fallen in love with the main menu from Halo 1, Halo 2, and to a lesser extent Halo 3. Too bad, cause they're gone.

Rather than being able to choose your game and being directed to the original menu screen, all the games have the same menu screen some blue planet with asteroids floating around it.. It sucks.  what does it have to do with Halo?

When I play Halo CE, I want to see the massive ring floating in space. When I play Halo 2, I want to see new mombasa in beautiful blue. Instead, you get some background that means absolutely nothing to those games. Where's the music you're nostalgic for? All gone. It's just a lazy port.

They'e redone the music for the games, and you can tell they sound different. When I play Halo CE, I want the exact same music I remember, not redone tracks. And these audio files are tiny, so why they couldn't both be inlcuded is beyond me. You cannot choose to listen to the original music, it forces the remixed tracks on you. Why? Why screw the games up so bad?

Also, the music will play too loud over the dialogue, making you miss parts of the story.

You cannot change between remake graphics and original graphics during cutscenes. Not a big deal, unless you're playing Halo CE and watching the long opening cutscene. You're forced to watch the anniversary remake, because you can't change back to the original until you reach gameplay. man it's astounding how bad they botched this.

During gameplay, you can switch between remake and original graphics, which is kinda cool on the surface, but in truth, is a huge mistake. There's long loading screens for every level now, and the background of these loading screens is a low res image from the hideous remake.

Remember playing Halo 2 and 3 without loading screens? No longer.

And Halo CE's iconic blue ring loading screen is gone. What? Looking at the ugly reskinned anniversary instead. man how do you screw something like this up?

See, you can't just choose to play the original game and ditch the hideous loading screens, no, you must suffer playing both games at once.

No original music, no original loading screens, no original title screens. Unbelievable.

The games just aren't Halo anymore. They screwed all of them up.

Finally, the worst offence:

There have been no polygon count increased for ANY of the original Halo games, only the remakes.

Unbelievable.

Why they couldn't have had the guys at bungie update the polygon counts is unforgivable.

The games just look dated because of it.

You've got these beautiful textures, animations and particle effects, mixed up with these horribly low poly objects.

Every gun, every character, every hand, everything, is sickeningly low poly. Like, you can count in a few seconds how many poly's went into chiefs hands and gun.

Halo CE and Halo 2 are from an era of gaming where polygon processing was in extremely short supply, and it shows.  Every single render in both games is visibly low poly.  Everything.  How gorgeous could these games look today with just a little TLC?

i just... Cannot believe how lazy these developers are. They could have let Bungie update their game really easily, but because Microsoft doesn't care, it didn't happen.

There's still time to fix all these problems, they just have to get off their lazy asses and make it happen. Contact the guys at Bungie and let them increase the poly counts.

Unfortunately, after using the Frontman controller, I greatly prefer the original Activision Les Paul controller that came with GH3.

First the good things: the Frontman controller does seem to be well constructed. The buttons all seem to be of high quality, and the design looks pretty cool. The whammy bar is also much more solid than on the GH3 Les Paul controller.

The main problem with this controller, however, is that the fret buttons are quite stiff. There is definite resistance in pushing these buttons down, and this resistance makes it fairly tough to play difficult solos in Expert mode. The fret buttons are also rounded and recessed, which again make them difficult to press quickly (the roundness also makes them difficult to hold for long periods of time). I became quite frustrated using the Nyko controller with tough GH3 songs.

One last downside - the Nyko controller, just like the GH3 Les Paul, is not compatible with Wii Rock Band. It's amazing how many accessory guitar controllers we have to buy just to have guitar and bass on both GH and Rock Band.  Sigh...

The scope in very fun to use and it even has it's own integrated Night vision, heat vision, and EMP (electro magnetic pulse) vision. The sam's visibilty meter is now a green (total darkness), yellow (visible yet undetected), and red (detected) light. There are so many new gadgets but now I will tell you the major downfalls. This game forced me to spend around $900 to buy a new processor, motherboard, and a video card at half price from a friend. Frankly, Ubisoft have formatted this to work with SM 2.0 which will probably cost them lots of money. Also I have heard (but I cannot be considered reliable) has announced they will not release a patch to fix this problem. In any case the game also has some wierd glitches but I won't go into details since they are very unnoteworthy. The only other annoying thing is that, if you want to get the good upgrades, then you have to go totally undetected the whole game. Mainly I rated this 3 stars overall because of the really annoying system requirements. Last thing I would like to say is, if you have a computer that will run this game, buy it since it is probably one of the best Splinter Cell's ever.",Fun Game but annoying little things,1163462400,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
3.0,False,"09 2, 2014",A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00H7KDPK8,Where the Sidewalk Ends,"For what it is right now, I'd rate this game somewhere around 3 stars. The high price for minimal starting content is where I was a little disappointed and it loses a star. I'm hoping once expansion packs start coming out, it will be a better game and rated more between 4 and 5 stars. The price for what you get right now is steep.

I've been playing Sims since Sims 1 (The Sims). Sims 2 was outstanding. I played the Sims Online when it was up and running, and while I didn't love the Sims 3 at first, over time it grew on me and I learned to love it. There was just so much content for Sims 3 with all the expansion packs, you could play for days and barely get into everything available for the game. There were plenty of bugs along the way, but to me the game was so much fun I fought through them anyway.

I knew going into Sims 4 the game would be at bare bones again. No stuff packs, expansions, no new worlds, pets, vacations or college. No Sim horses to ride, salons to work in or pyramids to explore. However I didn't expect the Sims 4 towns to be as small as they are and with as few lots on them as there is. After the large open worlds of Sims 3, going to a small town in the Sims 4 is hard to adjust to. And the towns are even smaller than expected.

So since there isn't a lot of places to go yet in the game, you are left with the focus being on learning all the new aspects of how your Sims work and how to use all the game's new features.

There are 2 neighborhoods in which you can play in right now, Willow Creek and Oasis Springs. These two towns follow the same kind of set-up as Sims 3 towns, a main park for Sims to go to as a social lot, surrounded by homes and a few shops. One big difference between Sims 3 and Sims 4 is the open world style of game is no longer used. Instead it's divided up more so into small groups of lots. You no longer travel across town by walking, driving or flying on a broomstick. You just put in the command to go to a location and you switch to a load screen, like the versions of Sims prior to Sims 3.

The positive thing I can see about going back to this non-open-world-design is the game should run somewhat better for those with computers with more minimal specs. The game doesn't need to have every home and every Sim in the entire neighborhood running at the same time. The town is broken down into small sections, and it's running just that section that your Sims is in. So those with less powerful graphics cards should be able to enjoy the game's graphics without having to turn them down to prevent crashing to their desktop.

Sims can now multi-task in a new way. Before, a Sim's version of multi-tasking might be gaining social with another Sim by playing chess with them. Now, you can play chess with one Sim and be holding a conversation with another Sim sitting somewhere else, like on a near by bench. It's more realistic in that a Sim can do more than one thing at once. Without thinking about it, I queued up for my Sim to go read a book after stopping in to use the bathroom, and instead my Sim went and picked up the book and took it to the bathroom as restroom reading material.

The traditional menus are still there, just rearranged a bit. You still have your Sims needs bars and skill bars. You can still adjust the speed of the game and can see your Sim's current mood. A nice tweak made in the game is that now Sims sleep MUCH faster. The game speeds up while Sims are sleeping to a speed far faster than in any other previous game. You no longer have to sit forever waiting for your Sim to sleep, even while at the fastest game speed. A whole night of sleep goes by in just a few seconds. More time playing, less time sleeping. A good thing!

I do like how the new Create a Sim system works. I can make small detailed changes to my Sim much more easily than before. There is a decent amount of clothing and hair options available right now to get you started.

The Sims themselves look better, I think, in the Sims 4 than in Sims 3. The features are smoother and the clothing details are nicer. You can change additional features in this Sims, like how they walk. However I found that even if you set a walk preference, your Sims mood will also change how they walk or stand. You can set your Sims to walk with swagger, but if their mood turns to sad, they will walk around with head hung.

The moods of your Sim are one of the biggest changes in Sims 4. Your Sims current mood gives you various different interactions, it changes your ability to increase skill level and your Sims posture, facial expressions and reaction to other Sims. And your mood can be changed by the smallest things, like watching TV. When my Sims sat down to watch a romance on TV, her mood turned into ""flirty"".

Just like the Create a Sim has some interesting new tools , so does the build menu for creating your home. There are new pre-styled rooms options offered in the build menu. You can search through a catalog of already designed and decorated rooms, buy the one you like and then stretch it to fit an empty room in your home. This makes putting together a nicely decorated house quite fast, and you know exactly how much you need to spend to get it looking the way you want.

I did find a few glitches within the first few hours of game-play. Nothing major yet, but small things like my pregnant Sim was not able to complete the task of using the bathroom, taking a shower or making a meal, no matter what I tried. They would start the process, then leave it right away uncompleted. as if it was canceled out. So there are a few things that will need patched.

I do like that the load screens are a lot faster. It use to seem like any time you saw a load screen in the Sims, it would be a while before you were back to playing again. Now the time between screen loads seems quite a bit quicker.

With time, patches and new expansion packs, I hope the game will have a lot more to offer. First impressions are that the game's current content is pretty minimal for the hefty price. I think they should have offered more content or charged less for what this game is so far. If you pick the Sims 4 up after it's dropped in price some, or after an expansion pack or two has come out, you will probably enjoy the game quite a bit more. It's not a bad Sims game, but it will probably be a better one in the future when there's more to do in game. I'm hoping it ends up being for me like the Sims 3 was, a slow start but with added content, a fun game in the end.","Has future potential, but minimal starting content and high price make it hard to love right now",1409616000,61,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Instant Access'}",

This game could have been a 5 Star Gem, but it's incredibly buggy, even two years after it has shipped.  It's a two sided coin, where one side is a sweeping epic adventure where your actions shape the world around you, and the other side is a buggy piece of crap.  You can enjoy this game if you save often in different save slots and try to ignore the characters that get stuck in walls or the occasional quests that can't be completed.  If that's a deal breaker, then you can gladly skip this game.

Story:  9/10
You're a courier who gets hired to deliver a mysterious package to a big shot in New Vegas.  Unfortunately for you, you get gunned down and left for dead before you can deliver the package.  But in Vegas, fortunes can change in an instant and you're rescued... after they put your face back together.  Once you're revived, you can explore the wasteland.  It's a great blend of the fallout universe and the old west.  There are rival factions, gangs, a host of NPC's fit to compliment every play style, farms, ruins, Las Vegas, and your decisions affect the outcome of just about everyone.

You affect the world by taking on quests, and just about all of them force you to make critical decisions about who you will help and who you will betray.  As you play, you'll meet a bunch of interesting characters who can travel with you as companions.  You can have 1 robot and 1 living humanoid with you at all times.  They all have their own back stories and quests as well.

Your Character:  9/10
When the game begins, you can customize the look and basic skill set of your character.  These skills compliment your play style.  If you want to be stealthy, you can focus on Sneak, Lock Picking, Hacking...  If you want to be persuasive, you can develop your Barter and Speech Skills.  If you want to focus on defense, there are Medical and Survival Skills which give you more health points from using medicine and food.  And of course there are different types of combat:  Guns, Energy Weapons, Explosives, Melee, and Unarmed Combat.  These skills enable you to get through the game just about any way that you want.

If you need to kill 2 guys, you can blow them up, shoot them, stab them, convince them to fight each other, poison them, trick them into surrendering...  The choices are yours to make.

Whenever you complete a quest, kill a guy, pick a lock, hack a computer, etc... You gain XP.  When you gain enough XP, you go up in level.  Here, you can add skill points to improve your skills and every other level you can add a Perk.  Perks are set skills that help you.  Better Critical Hits, Heal in Sunlight, Carry More Items, Take Less Damage from Radiation, Have a Mysterious Stranger Randomly Help You...

The character progression system really allows you to improve your character in every way possible and there are no skill trees, so you don't have to worry about making mistakes.  Once you get a Perk, it is always active.

Gameplay:  7/10
The gameplay is pretty solid.  You travel, make dialogue decisions, and accomplish mission objectives.  You can do this by shooting, blowing things up, stealth, trickery, or forming alliances with important people.  Once you discover a new area, you can fast travel to it at any time, using your mini-map.

Whenever you talk to someone, you get options based on your skills.  So, if some rifraff tries to BS you, you can call them on it.  The more skilled you are, the more dialogue options appear.  For example:  If you have a high Explosives Skill and you're talking to a bomb expert, you can relate to him through your knowledge of explosives and win them over.

Combat:  7/10
There are many ways to kill your enemies.  If you use guns, you can shoot them in real time.  You can also use the VATS system, which pauses the game and gives you action points and allows you to aim at a body part or weapon of an enemy with strategic benefits.  If someone is running away, you can shoot them in the leg to slow them down.  If you are fighting a giant insect, shooting their antennae confuse them and they attack their allies.  If an enemy is holding a grenade, you can shoot it to blow him up.

You can also use grenades, land mines, melee weapons, your fists, and stealth.  You get major bonus damage for attacking an enemy while you are hiding.  You can also reverse pickpocket someone and put a grenade in their pocket.  A few seconds later, they explode.
There are two basic kinds of enemies in the game.  Melee enemies who charge you, and missile enemies you shoot at you.  There are also a ton of different damage types.  Energy weapons work well against machines and will occasionally vaporize enemies.  Guns have hollow point ammo for unarmored enemies and armor piercing bullets for armored ones.  Explosives are great at breaking limbs.  Hand to Hand combat is good at knocking enemies down, disarming them, killing them, or crushing their limbs.  In just about every encounter, you'll be making some critical decisions.

Hardcore Mode!
This makes the game much tougher.  Your health items only give back health over time.  So instead of getting an instant 100HP back, you might get 5HP over 10 seconds, which makes you vulnerable.  You also have to eat, drink, and sleep or suffer stat penalties.  If your companions get killed, they stay dead.  This is pretty rough, but it does make the game feel a bit more realistic.  This can be turned on or off at any time.

World:  8/10
The world is full of rival factions, mutants, ghouls, military, robots, and people just trying to survive.  Some of the quests are tragic, some are hilarious, some are epic, and some make you think.  And of course, you could just wander around for hours and see what kind of trouble you can get yourself into.

Graphics:  8/10
The graphics are pretty good for a huge big world type of game.  The art direction blends the 1950's and ruins quite nicely and New Vegas is well done.  The characters look OK, but their animations are a little stiff.

Sound:  8/10
The soundtrack is pretty good and features Frank Sinatra, epic music, exploration music, etc...  They all set the scene quite nicely.  The sound effects are good and help round out the action.  The dialogue is pretty flat.

Bugs:  10/10
I had the game crash on a load screen and it wiped out my auto save.  I lost 6 hours of gameplay.  How does this happen in 2010?  The game frequently crashes about every 2-4 hours, so save often and have multiple saves.  You and other characters get stuck on trees, cars, walls, buildings, rocks, etc...  You may be able to ""fast travel"" with your automap if you get stuck outside.  If this happens when you are indoors, you have to restart.  Enemies sometimes turn into a blob of polygons and some quests are broken.  This is the buggiest 360 game that I've played.

Replay Value:  10/10
There is no multiplayer, but the game is about 60 hours long and there are multiple endings.  You can start over with a new character and play the game over in a whole new way and get different endings.

Maturity:  M
There is swearing, sexual situations involving people, ghouls, robots...  gambling, decapitations, dismemberment, blood, etc...  This game is about as wholesome as a trip to Vegas with the Mafia.

Overall:  6/10
This could have been an 80 hour epic adventure where you control the fate of the world, playing any way you wanted to...  Instead, this is a game where the immersion constantly breaks down as you try to navigate around a minefield of bugs.  For most people, it isn't worth the trouble.

Buy it cheap if you like Bethesda Games like Oblivion, Fallout 3, or Skyrim.
Buy it cheap if you like the old west feel of Red Dead Redemption.
Buy it cheap if you like games that allow you to play creatively.
Rent it if you have 60 hours to blow through it... err... you're better off buying it cheap.

Avoid this game if you need good acting.

I didn't like the constant tutorials that pop up even if you've already done what it's telling you to do 900 times (such as jumping to grab a ledge), and you have no option to turn them off. They pop up every single time no matter how many times you've done it.

My theory is, the first wave of games (I'll consider Metal Gear Solid the next gen) are pretty much good for one kind of thing.  It's either massive battle attck (like Sangoku Musoo -- Dynasty Warriors), cool swordplay/swashbuckling zombie killing action (like in Onimusha -- Warlords), or Robot simulation like in Gundam.  I rate of the above games with a 4 stars.  ""X Squad"" (or ""Cross Fire"" as it is called in Japan) is actually pretty good -- I didn't buy it until I could get used.  That is a good price to pay for this highly engaging shoot-em-up game.  Think of Metal Gear Solid, minus the stealth imperative, for its action and feel as you try to take out the army of bad guys.  As the Amazon editor said, it isn't a perfect game.  But, I've already spent more than 3-4 days playing it, always trying to go back and improve my skills on the lower levels.
Considering that most experienced gamers can probably beat Warlords (prob. what is so far the most beautiful, rich game out there), this game is nice in that you don't feel the need to speed through levels.  Taking out the bad guys with teamwork and carefully placed shots is really fun.  I agree with the AMZN editor -- you definitely can't count on your buddies to win the game for you, but steadily improving them is challenging and part of the game's appeal.

How apt it feels then to have them do a Lego version of Rock Band and surprisingly it doesn't suck. But then again it's not perfect by any stretch and there's some annoyances that really grind my gears so to speak but then I'm an adult and when you mention the term ""Lego Rock Band"", it feels like you're 4 talking about quantum physics, it just doesn't look right, does it? Keep in mind there's nothing wrong with the game and I actually smiled quite a few times playing the game but then as far as gameplay is concerned I noticed some step downs from Rock Band 2 and even the Beatles game that I wish weren't part of this game. Families won't mind but if you're looking for more songs to play than you're kind of out of luck.

This is kind of a simple review since it's not really that story extensive or there's much to talk about so I'll just mention the gameplay. Personally, as a frequent Rock Band 2 player I'm not exactly digging the interface. Keep in mind I'm mainly a drummer in these kind of games so I'll chat about that with some mentions later of the guitar. If you play on expert you know how vitally important it is to distinguish when to hit a certain pad and cymbal together and when it's just one or the other in more complicated sections. I don't know if it's just me but I found it really hard to tell what to play when the bass pedal got more active and there was more notes as opposed to Harmonix games where I could easily tell and more than once I couldn't tell if it was just one note or a double tap or if the note was exactly on the bass pedal or in front of it. As far as the guitar is concerned, this was where it got tricky since at times it was hard to tell what was 2 separate notes and what was hammer-ons/pull-offs and while it's easily understood in lazier sections, when things get kicked up a notch, you're like ""wait, are these all hammer-ons or separate notes?""

Another annoyance is in regards to the setlist during story in that it doesn't give you the option to automatically pick the next set. For example, the game is telling me to advance I need to play a Rock Challenge (describe those in a minute) at a certain set yet I can't see it, well turns out I had to go to my Rock Den where you can buy your instruments, decorate your lair and customize your character, pick another vehicle and play the set. Why isn't it like Rock Band 2 where upgrading your vehicle automatically upgrades your tour dates? For the rock challenges, these are actually quite fun even though they're just regular old playthroughs of songs, catch is you have to perform and through the power of rock, something special as to happen. The first you'll run into is to demolish a building with a Hives song (because it rocks? or because it's terrible and the building couldn't take it?). The one that practically had me smiling ear to ear though was where you have to exorcise ghosts from a mansion and what better way to do that than Ray Parker Jr's ""Ghostbusters"".

As far as the setlist, it's incredibly odd. There's some songs for the younger kiddies like Ghostbusters and even Kung Fu Fighting and Pink and songs that I'd personally would love to have in Rock Band 2 such as Summer of 69, You Give Love a Bad Name, and wouldn't you know it, another Foo Fighters song (seriously Harmonix, we don't need their entire catalogue as DLC, stop) but then you get indie bands barely anybody knows about and while I'm glad to see more Queen, I'm not lying when I say We Will Rock You is one of the most repetitive drum charts I've ever seen. Not to mention it's actually a short setlist and while DLC from RB1/RB2 will work, only select ones that have been cleared will transfer over which makes for some weird moments when the random song set gave me Won't Get Fooled Again, still one of the hardest Expert drum songs there is and at 7-8 minutes long, a curious entry to a family game with decidely short attention spans. Speaking of, there's a Super Easy mode where all you really have to do is hit the notes, regardless of what it is and you'll pass which sounds good for players but considering No Fail option is here, it feels kind of superflous. Oh and there's an option to have automatic kick drums too. Too bad this wasn't available for Visions, eh?

I think most people will just buy this game so they can export the setlist to Rock Band 2 or if they're into family games. While there's some songs here I'd love to have as DLC, the game itself feels like a step back despite the fact it's undeniably adorable.","Perfect for families, so-so for the rest",1257724800,20,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Sadly, Freedom Force vs. the Third Reich (FFVTR)did not live up to expectations.  To be direct about it, the game, which is based on the juicy premise of sending the original FF members back in time to battle energy-x powered nazis, suffers from the same problems that plauged the original FF plus a plot and character development sceme that seems rushed and ill-concieved.

Most of the problems with the game revolve around the fact that the game is far too short.  I didn't count how many missions there were, but I finished it in less than a week (playing about 2-hrs/day).  The abruptness of the missions do not allow the plot of the game to become as immersive as many classic squad based games, like Desperados and ST: Away Team.  Furthermore, while there are many new ""superheros"" to choose from, the fact that there are so few missions means that you will never get a chance to recruit and experiment with all of them.  The original FF, while still not being a ""long"" game had at least 20 missions, and was slightly better in this regard.

A second problem is an obvious lack of necessity to use any other strategy than to follow the arrows and beat the hell out of the AI opponents (who are not that intimidating). Stealth, long and short-range attacks, and positioning of squad members all seem less relevant that how long your characters can simply stand toe-to-toe with enemies.  This might fair well with the 12 year old playstation geeks, but certainly not with a Fallout vet!

Third, the AI opponents are really not that great (character-wise or strength-wise), with the only real exception being an Ice Giant version of Nuclear Winter, who you enconter early in the game.  On this note, I wanted to give this game a fair review, so I played it twice; once in ""Hard"" mode and the other time in ""very hard"" mode and found the lack of challenging AI rather disturbing.  This problem of retarded AI becomes tenfold if you just create your custom superhero who can bash the crap out of everyone all by himself without the help of any built-in superheroes!

Anyway, on the positive side, the graphics and interface are superb.  The interface is even smoother than the original FF and you shouldn't have any problem with crashes or lockups unless you're using an antiquated system.  Also, the ""character origin"" stories are really nice and thoughtfully rendered.  Unfortuntely, these features just made me more dissapointed at the abbreviated gameplay.

For the rest of us, at first glance between an XBox 360 game and a regular XBox game, there isn't much difference.  It's true, on an HDTV the games are a sight to behold (most of them anyway) but a majority of them just don't have that ""next-gen"" feel.

The only games that come close to this are Perfect Dark Zero and Project Gotham 3, while third party titles such as Dead or Alive 4, GUN, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, King Kong, Madden '06, and Ridge Racer 6, still look and play like current-gen titles.  Now here's the thing; the XBox 360 has the potential to be something truly great, and with games like the next installment in the Elder Scrolls series, and of course Halo 3 on the horizon, the future of this console seems bright.  The system itself looks cool and sleek, and the XBox Live support is still the best online console gaming around today; so for XBox faithfuls, you really can't go wrong.

So I love that they returned with elements and characters from those games-- even though the stories are too action-laden and unbelievable even by RE's outlandish standards. I felt as if they needed to pause the action sometimes, let the player regroup and determine what else was planned *in order to build tension* (as they did in the classic games from this series) THEN we could go in with guns blazing.
Instead, as someone mentioned in a previous review, it's like Call of Evil (to combine two titles) with the nonstop action and shooting, which is good in some regards and an insult to the series in other regards.
I completed Leon's story, and I'm halfway through Chris' story. Leon's story was mostly an insult to his RE 2 roots, although I was glad to see that he briefly reunited with people from RE 2 (I won't spoil it). Chris' scenario is actually much funner to me, but I can't shake the feeling that this game should have remained faithful to its survival/atmospheric origins.
For me, the controls were very difficult to adapt to at first because I'm accustomed to survival and roleplaying games, but by the time I completed Leon's quest and moved on to Chris I was such a bada-- that I felt as if the background music should have been something from the Django Unchained shootout: ""AM I WRONG 'CAUSE I WANNA GET IT ON 'TIL I DIE?!""
Slaughter. Total slaughter.
As other people have mentioned, the sudden deaths that are unavoidable such as a giant hurling a car at me because I didn't move 20 feet in the two seconds that were allotted to me are my #2 complaint.

The rubberized sides give it good grip.  The scroll wheel has a decent feel with just the right amount of resistance and solid detents for weapon selection in FPS games.  The mouse has a good weight.  It is about as heavy as other, more expensive mice that have adjustable weights with them fully loaded.  The tracking seems very precise.

The bad: DPI switching - there is only one button for DPI switching which you have to press repeatedly to scroll through the five settings.  This is bad, but wouldn't be as bad if you had some indication of which setting you were on.  Every other DPI-switching mouse I have had has had an indicator telling you which setting you are on.  With this mouse it is pure guesswork, which is death in a FPS game.  If I am on 3000 dps and I want to get to 800 dps, I would have to just keep pressing the same button and moving the mouse around trying to guess which setting I was on.  While this mouse is made to be ambidextrous, doing so sacrifices ergonomics.  It has an unnatural feel in the hand and for me it seems a bit too long.  The side buttons have a cheap, plasticky feel and movement.  The thumb button is a bit too far forward and difficult to reach without moving you hand forward.

First, the compass within the game is useless.  If there is a logical way to understand it then I'm at a loss.  I bought a used copy and so there were no manual associated with this game but a compass is a compass and I had a hard time knowing where I was heading and where I already was.

Second, the game lags a lot.  Walk into a town and you will notice a lot of eye candy but then you start to walk around and your running speed is that of a normal walk.  The camera angles in towns and dungeons were also very restrictive, not allowing me to see what is on the other side of the street because a tall building was blocking my view of what is underneath it.

Third, I would like to mention that this game is very easy.  There is no need to draw out maps or anything and hardly any needs to fear exploration.  This is because there is about 2 save points that allows free restoration in each location.  One is at the start and the other is right before a hard part.  What smart players are going to do is clear the whole map and then go for a heal before meeting the boss.  There is no need to be efficient about your magic since you can easily restore it.

The game, I believe was made for beginners.  There is an auto-fight command but there is very little need for it since there is little need to level your characters up.  The only use for this auto-fight command that I can think of is if you wish to accumulate a lot of money to buy the best set of armor that the current town sells to stay within level of the monsters (or if you didn't find the 500 gold treasure box within the map.",Ideal for RPG beginers,1145059200,2,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Iv052UX-L._SY88.jpg']

True, MoH-AIRBORN may not be at par with the first MoH games, yet it is the successor MoH-PACIFIC ASSAULT failed to become! New movement options (peak above and below), a few RPG sprinkles (weapons upgrades!), improved graphics (especially the shadows!) and realistic factor (you REALLY need to get used to shooting from cover!). Finally, it is the unpredictability of where you start your mission and in what order you get your objectives completed that add some clear points to this game.

Now, here are the bad news:
- The game is TOO SHORT. By any standard. EA let, once more, greed get the better of their decision making: I am sure, as you are reading this, the other half of the game is getting burned onto disks labeled ""Expansion"".
- Checkpoints. I hate checkpoint games! Not only because you usually end up dying just before reaching the next one - but mostly because it is the gimmick used by game publishers to artificially augment the game's duration (by having us replay the same segments again and again...).
- The game is hit by the STALKER curse. The STALKER curse is when an excellent game is actually engineered for the...next generation of computers. STALKER is a uniquely open-ended FPS-RPG - yet my copy is gathering dust. My computer is not that shabby (P4 3.2MHZ, 2GB RAM, nVidia 7600GT-512MB on ASUS P4P 800) yet, as with STALKER, MoH-AIRBORN stutters and freezes all the time (and I found out that this is true even to people with even much faster PC systems).
As with STALKER, when I will have the system to play MoH-AIRBORN to its full potential, the game will be obsolete.

All in all, a good game if you have the PC system to handle its true requirements (and the patience to even then endure inconveniencing moments).",A GOOD GAME - HIT BY THE ...S.T.A.L.K.E.R. CURSE,1192147200,28,,

Graphics: 6.5/10 The best thing about this game is definitely the graphics. They aren't as good as some PSP titles out right now, but they are still pretty good. A decent framerate that usually holds out in mini-battles, that's the best part about it.

Sound: 7/10 There really isn't that much sound besides guns shooting and hearing the repetetive sounding creatures make the same noise to you every few seconds. Nothing special here.

Control: 6.5/10 Like most PSP shooting games, the controls are terrible. There are different ways to customize how you want to control, but this is just another example of why Sony should have put two analog nubs on the PSP.

Gun: 6/10 This game is downright repetetive. Nothing different happens for pretty much the whole game. Get through the level by killing ""gate keepers"" and voila. You will beat the game. It's not that hard, but it's REALLY not fun. So if you want to play a decent shooter for the PSP, look elsewhere. I suggest SOCOM: Fireteam Bravo. Stay away from Coded Arms.

The back story is well done, 7 different fations from the ship with differing political views decide to seperate upon arrival at the planet, and start their own civilisations.
The game is similar to the civ games, but if offers numerous improvements upon civ2. The controls are far more streamlined, and the computer interacts with you far more than in previous civ games. If you want, you can automate every unit and just manage city production, or vice versa, which saves times for those players with little.
The entire story and details of the game are a little weird to get your head around, this game starts off from a very high technology level, so naturally higher levels are hard to understand.
One thing I had a problem with in the game was that one of the political factions was a religious fundamnetalist group called 'The Believers', who's religion was christianity. So if you went to war with them, you were effectively fighting christianity, by destroying cities with names like 'The Hand of God' and 'New Eden'. As a christian, I had a problem with this, and it was one of the reasons I only gave this game 3 stars. It was my understanding that game designers tended to steer away from involving christianity heavily in their work, particularly in opposing it, simply out of respect for the religion. ...

3.0,False,"06 12, 2008",A2TCHXH4SIN2OF,B000FPOJOS,Severian,"Another great looking GT game with semi-simulation game play and some annoyingly unresolved core issues. Your opponents are still mindless cruise missiles who do not respond to your presence on the track at all and who never make mistakes. Plus damage modeling remains absent, though promised DLC sometime this summer is supposed to address that issue. Those of us who remember the ""damage"" system from GT2 (or Forza for that matter) where you hit a wall at 140 and then the car pulls a bit to the right may be a bit skeptical as to how this will be implemented. The usual GT combination of annoyingly flawless competitors and no damage makes using the other cars as bumpers to improve cornering as tempting as ever, especially in some of the more brutally difficult challenges. (See below.)

This specific implementation has some unique issues. Those of you who feel the GT-R is a bit over-hyped will quickly grow tired of all the added background content about that vehicle in the game. Much like the Acura NSX was the former over favorably modeled vehicle in prior GTs, the GT-R here seems a bit too perfect. A good third of the 75 cars in GT5) featured are useless and boring, a familiar problem from GT4 with its dozens of bland Japanese cars that those outside the Nipponese car buying market could care less about. (5 Skyline Models! 7 Suzuki and Daihatsu Micro-Cars!) However, most of the cars here are reasonably interesting and the graphics are beautiful. The handling model also appears to be as accurate and distinctive for each car as might be expected.

The mere six tracks in the game grow very tiring very quickly. The Daytona oval is as dull as could be imagined, and the London circuit, though gorgeous, is under-utilized in the actual in-game events due to the fact that it has no decent straights and too many sharp angled turns.

Besides bad opponent AI, no damage, GT-R propaganda, a few dull cars, and a teeny variety of tracks, are there any other problems? You betcha! The real problem here is the gameplay. There are about 40 races in the game total at this point, grouped into 4 tiers, each of which must be completed in order to advance. Some of the races, especially in the A tier, are vastly difficult especially A-8, the Ferrari pass them all in one lap. If you can't win that last race in the tier, you need to grind away over and over until you finish it in order to advance.

When you finally get to the last tier (""S""), you will be disappointed; though you can now finally tune your cars, your tuning options mainly amount to either minute changes in camber and brake balance a la NASCAR, or beefing hp up / weight down or vice versa in order to balance cars out in each race. The added ""joy"" of S class racing is the return of the GT4 5 second penalty for bumping other racers and / or the landscape. As was also the case in GT4, you are penalized even if the drone racers hit you, while they are not.

The game so ends with a whimper rather than a bang as you strap weights onto your car to trim it into the point category, and then grind your teeth in frustration as your cruise missile opponents hit you from behind and vanish into the horizon as you lose the race because of the penalty levied because of the unavoidable and unintentional collision. An actual damage system and opponents with more brains than a pigeon would be a much better solution to the bumper cars problem, but this is what the geniuses at Polyphony give us instead.

To add insult to injury, the GT crew in recent news have announced that the actual GT5 game may not be out till 2010 and the much hyped DLC upgrade may not be out in summer 08 as originally promised. Lovely! In the meantime, why buy this at all? I would suggest buying Grid instead, which is a fully realized game with functional damage, an actual campaign structure, challenging artificial opponents who also make mistakes and even crash at times, and more than twice as many tracks. Sure there is no trendy BGM, the handling is not as realistic, and there are less cars modeled than GT5P, but damage and human style opponent AI more than make up for those deficiencies.

Rent GT5P if you want to see the pretty graphics, play Grid during the loooong wait for the real GT5 and then see if the end Polyphony product is a worthy enough game to spend 60 clams on. Content and graphics in the GT games are fine, but the series needs to see damage modeling and more challenging competition in the single player game in order to remain a viable contender in the next-gen racing game market.","Same Old Same Old, Though a Bit Prettier",1213228800,28,,

I have been playing football since the good old days of Techmo Bowl on plain old vanilla Ninentendo.  This years Madden is just not that great.

Why do I say this?  Well, for one, the graphics aren't really that good.  The new default angle is from such a far away vantage point that you can see the whole field, but, it also makes everything looked horribly pixelated.  There is a lot some full screen anti-aliasing could do for this picture, especially when you consider how small the screen and therefore the resolution must be already.  You can change this somewhat with the ""zoom"" camera mode, but this mode makes it kind of difficult to see where your receivers are since, it drops the angle of view down to almost horizontal.  The other views either make the graphics look awful, or don't help with gameplay.

The other thing, which is similar to the NCAA 09 ""freshman mode"" is the oversimplification of this game in order to widen their market.  It was not too bad an idea with NCAA 09, but I doubt it would widen the appeal of Madden fans with a 'basic' set of controls, since it is the competitive spirit which makes you try to learn the controls and get better.  If you like to quit when you can't ""get"" a game, then you don't have the kind of competitve drive needed to be a Madden addict, and you will probably get bored with the game quickly.

Almost all other aspects of the game are the same as last year, with the exception of not turning the angle of the camera around when playing defense.  People like me have been used to your team staring off at the bottom of the screen no matter offense or defense for so long that this is just plain annoying.  I mean, it totally changes the thumb motion on the d-pad to the less natural down motion, and it makes it more difficult to judge your players position in space by having him up at the top of the screen where he the field is narrower and he is smaller.

I could understand this if the game no longer paused every time you made an interception, but it still does!  So, how does changing the angle get you more ""immersed"" into the game?  It doesn't!  It makes it more difficult, and now the game pauses a moment when you make an interception, which is lame, and it doesn't have that awe inspiring rotation of the screen, which makes things more dramatic!

Things are still clearly not immersive in the fact that you pause when you make an interception.  Rarely, in live games that I have seen do they pause the live action when that happens, therefore, this is very non immersive.  But, if they could pause the live game and rotate the screen like they do in Madden, it would be very appealing to fans watching the game.

This isn't a bad game.  The controls are different, the graphics are awful, and it lacks some of the things that made playing Madden more fun, and it is now accessible to idiots.  Sounds like something a loyal fan would just eat up, right?  Well, the sound track is better, and I like the new rosters, and the stadium graphics have improved.  Overall, this is an ok game.  They took a few small steps forward, and a few more noticble steps backward.

The only reason I am not giving it 2 stars, is the fact that I don't want to sound like one of those whiners who complain every year.  I have been quite faithful up to now, because I could see some improvement.  Now, this is getting ridiculous.

Don't get me wrong, I am a big VH fan, but I am also a Guitar Hero fan. And unlike prior GH band-exclusive versions (Metallica, Aerosmith) which seemed created as love-letters to their fans, there are virtually no extras here whatsoever. No videos, no song notes, the presentation is generic at best...it's as if the folks at Guitar Hero made this bootleg version with no cooperation from the band, not intended for public release but somehow got leaked to the black market.

The songs are classic VH, most are fun to play, but I think these days they could have made GH: Roy Orbison and got the same thing. Again, my opinion, it would have been better to make this a downloadable track-pack with characters for $19.99, opposed to charging full retail at time of release, with no more extras than when it was given away for free.

I've been a big VH fan for well over 25 years, and I cannot recall a press release, commercial, or any acknowledgment whatsoever from anyone in the Van Halen camp about this game?

I am a huge fan of the previous Arkham games, and was very much looking forward to playing this next installment. Then, I heard that it was no longer being developed by Rocksteady. This turned my excitement into worry. Still, I sucked it up and waited.

Finally the game arrived, and I popped it into my PS3 system, and was treated to...an almost exact duplicate of Arkham City. Yes, the graphics and sound are amazing, because the graphics and sound were amazing in arkham city. I didn't notice any major improvements. You zipped around the city, you find Riddlers hidden packages scattered abouts, you grill riddlers stoolies to find out new locations.

If you are expecting a brand new experience and think this game will be an improvement as Arkham City was to Arkham Asylum, you have another think coming. Again, other than story, this next installment brings nothing new to the table, at least in the main campaign. (Although exploring the batcave is kind of nifty, having a wayne manor mission would have been kind of cool as well).

What this game does add to the Arkham franchise is it's online gameplay, that lets you create your own thug, and get assigned to either the Jokers gang, or banes gange. Once you reach level 2, you unlock the ability to play as a hero(Batman or Robin). The online mode is actually quite fun and entertaining. To me, this alone was worth the price, though if you aren't much into online gaming this means little to nothing to you.

One nice thing is, that the game is fairly lengthy, which is rare for games that offer online modes. The game provides something for both the campaign player as well as the death matcher, which was refreshing.

Overall, if you enjoy online gaming, and the Arkham games, then you need to own this title. Otherwise, it may not be worth your money, and you might be better off waiting to rent it, or pick up a used copy. $60.00 is a bit much considering the campaign feels less like a new game, and more like an expansion pack for Arkham City.",Love the online play!,1383868800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First, the positives. The graphics are nice, yet a bit choppy at times. The sound and realism is where this game falls short. It's more ""cartoonish"" than other shooters out there. The sound is TREMENDOUSLY unimpressive. The ""planning stage"" and waypoints take alot of time, and can bore you. The weapons are ok, but you get most of them right when you start. I'm yet to locate a health meter, or a quick save if there even is such a thing. This is VERY similar to the first Rainbow series.

(PLEASE NOTE: this review is for the cable while using a PS3, I did not have a wii to test it with)

I bought this because I am deployed and I didn't want to have to buy an hdtv when I already have a 19' monitor I use for my laptop. I was pleasantly suprised at all the subtle features included with this cable. It came with a gender adapter for the cable which was a lifesaver for me because I didn't want to have to unplug the cable everytime I switched between my PS3 and Laptop. Also notable is the extension cables for the audio which even includes a headphone jack! (brilliant inclusion as far as im concerned because I can play my PS3 without waking people up!) And now the bad parts: Right away my biggest peeve was the installation. It requires you to hook the cable to a tv and your pc monitor silmantaneously when you first install it. This is frustrating mainly because they give you very little cable slack between the av plug and the vga plug. I was forced to hold the tv up with one hand and adjust the settings because I couldn't make the cords reach between the tv and monitor otherwise. And now the Ugly: Theoretically this adapter can support all the way up to 1080P. But because it is only a cable and it doesnt have its own dedicated box your images look a little washed out, the picture was also dark on both monitors I tried even after I adjusted brightness and contrast, and worst of all you have to adjust the screen with your monitor controls to make the image fit properly... something you will be doing almost every time you insert a different game or movie. 720p Gave me the best results on the two monitors I tried this cable with. (19 and 21 inch lcd monitors)

PROS:
-Cheap Solution For a Hi-Def Experience
-99% Artifact Free Image
-Inclusion of gender adapter was a nice courtesy
-Headphone jack a much appreciated add-on
-Great Value Considering you can use this for PS3 and WII

CONS:
-Image appears a little washed out, Though still noticeably improved over the regular AV cable.
-Lack of Dedicated box means you will be rescaling the image manually...often...
-Initial setup is clunky and frustrating.
-Even after adjusting you are sometimes forced to let parts of the screen be cut off.

OVERALL:

I was slightly dissapointed with the overall package. I have owned a vga adapter for Dreamcast as Well as XBX360 and both would beat the snot out of this cable. The fact that I had to manually adjust my picture every time it changed resolutions wasn't just frustrating but seemed ridiculous to me. However on the same token I am enjoying my ps3 games in high def without having to spend moolah on an hdtv. With this cable it was easy for me to switch between my stereo system or a pair of headphones which is convenient. Overall it was a decent buy for the price, but I hope some other company (or god forbid Sony themselves!) will step up and release something better in the future. Get it if you cant afford an hdtv or are short on space, etc. But if you have an hdtv handy, just spring for the official Sony Component Cables, youll be much happier I promise.","Great Design, a Few Flaws (PS3)",1219449600,50,,

The downsides however are as follows:

The interface is a little clunky, it's kind of a pain to navigate to what you want to play.  If you just want to go through the lessons in a linear fashion, it's pretty good, but if you want to try a particular song or game, it remembers where you left off and navigating back can be confusing at first.  I guess after a while it would be easier, but I haven't had achance to play it long enough to become that accustomed to it.

There really should be a way to lock in the difficulty.  What I mean by this, is that the game will see you hittin a lot of notes and then start adding more without any warning, so if you are getting into a rythym, it can throw you off looking for the new note you have not been playing previously, then when you screw up, it ramps it back down.  I think the option to lock in a song at a particular difficulty, then up it with subsequent play throughs would be better.

Sometimes, it's hard to see where you should be playing, the notes can be really close together and hard to figure out on teh screen sometimes.  Also, when charts on te screen shift hand position, you need to adjust quickly.

Sure the game has its moments of spooky survival and dark things that go bump in the night, but i wasn't too impressed with the final product.

The 'room' gets very annoying quick. You have to go back to your room a bajillion times throughout the game to save, heal, swap items (because of the super annoying inventory system), exorcise hauntings, and read clues under your door. Having to go back to the same old dull looking apartment room gets old too fast.

Plus some of the areas are downright confusing. The circular prison and subway system will have you running in circles figuring out what and where to go next. And i was hardly impressed with the level design. The hospital was a large hallway with 10 rooms like a grid. And the apartment complex and sports store level were nothing but similar stairways and rooms. The levels lacked originality in my book and the only one i really enjoyed was the forest and orphanage. Spooky stuff there.

And quite possibly the worst thing about Silent Hill 4 is the combat. Every enemy, from the dogs to the two headed monsters to the nurses followed the same attack pattern. And knocking each one down then 'stomping' them gets tedious too. And sometimes you will keep attacking a downed enemy while another standing enemy is right beside you! Annoying? Yes.

And don't even let me get started on the horrible, ugly, dumb,  partner you pick up halfway through the game. Having to constantly protect and walk slow for a useless 2nd character was terrible.

I look on the box and see it is a Zelda Download code, so great, have to download the game, but that shouldn't take too long.

I get the Wii U out and after getting it installed into my home system, I start the Wii up.  Find I have to setup the network, then setup a user account, check to see if any of my old user account information could transfer over, etc.  An hour later I had my Wii started.  My 8 year old son was very impatient to play Zelda by this point, but I told him I had to download it first.

I finally try to go to the store, have to wait for a system update, another 20 minutes or something, finally get into the store and have to download Zelda and the E-Book included.  I download both, it starts with the 270 MB or so E-Book and takes forever to download it, and find that Zelda is 1.7 GB.  We decide to start reading the E-Book and let Zelda download in the background.  An hour later we check on Zelda and it hadn't done anything and had an error and quit.  It resumed after we checked on it.

Long story shorter, 4 hours later we were able to get into Zelda and play, because Nintendo must have the slowest download servers on the planet.  Why can't they put the 50 cent disc in the box?

That aside, the neutral rating on the Wii U is because it is the slowest console I have ever used, switching between screens is on the order of 10 seconds, where it was very quick on the original Wii.  Amazon and Netflix constantly lock up and crash the Wii U necessitating a trip up to the console to hold the power button for 4 seconds.

The Wii U controller display is always on, even when streaming video to the TV, draining the batteries so your game pad is always discharged when you need it, or permanently stuck on the charger.  Battery life of the game pad is only okay, a couple hours maybe, which really isn't enough for an afternoon of game play.

Why don't I give it 1 star?  It is still fun to play if you can put up with all the issues.  The included Zelda game is fun, not one I had played before, and looks good on my high def TV, but clearly not up to the standards of other game systems.

First, if you have vertigo or get motion sick at all, take your dramamine because I got nauseaus quite a bit from moving the screen.  The sound of this game was the biggest negative to me since the sound is so important to me because it can draw you into the game but this sound was so irritating I had to turn it off.

3.0,True,"09 30, 2012",AZEVEWSU9G8GR,B00503EAG2,aviosis,"Let's start with some good things about this game.

PROS:
-Addicting as heck especially considering that you level up pretty quickly, but there's a ton of stuff to unlock (emblems, proficiencies, perks, mods, etc.) and each weapon has a unique feel to it.
-Killstreaks are rewarding... albeit a bit too rewarding (covered in the cons later)
-Matchmaking system is decently fast as long as you have a decent internet connection.
-Single player was epic. Felt a bit too linear at times but the cutscenes and dialogue and storyline are pretty engaging.
-Spec Ops mode, for when you just feel like challenging yourself.
-A bit more realistic than the other COD series, where you could get hit 5 times up close and not die. In this game, you can die in 3 pistol bullets at close range. Makes for a challenging and highly rewarding experience.
-Perks are a bit more balanced than in MW2.

Let's move onto the bad things about this game. Just to let you know I'm a huge COD fan AND a BF3 fan, but I'll do my best to review this from a COD player's perspective and leave BF3 to a Battlefielder's perspective.

CONS:
-Hackers. Hackers, hackers, hackers. This is especially problematic on PC. You'd think a perm IP ban on steam might scare these guys away, but nope. I've consistently seen level 50+ players using aimbots and locking on/following players through walls... players like me who use Asssassin Pro and Dead Silence and silenced weapons.

-Lag. Delay in registry makes for some pretty disgusting hitmarker moments. Since it's peer2peer based connection instead of dedicated server connection, host migration gets really annoying. If the host lives on Mars or some remote galaxy and has terrible internet connection, you're better off leaving the match and joining another game rather than risking extreme teleportation/death due to warping players whom you can't even hit because they're rubberbanding so hard.

-80% of the maps suck. The only decent maps are Terminal, Mission, Village, and Dome. I'm not sure what the developers were thinking when they were making the maps, because some of them are just disgusting and downright terrible - full of ridiculous camping spots and overall not a pleasure to play.

-Copies over a lot of the weapons from MW2. Hence, the affectionate nickname COD:MW2.5. P90, .44 Magnum, M16A4, ACR, UMP, AA-12, SPAS-12, Barrett .50 Cal, Dragunov, USP, and Desert Eagle just to name a few. And they're almost the exact same in terms of weapon firing and reloading/swapping animations. Funny how you pay $60 for a game with a ton of brand new weapons (MW2) and then you have to pay $60 again for a game that copies over half the guns of its predecessor.

-Shotguns are too underpowered and take too much patience/effort to unlock the range/damage proficiencies. I'm talking mostly the KSG-12, SPAS-12, and M1887. Only time they kill in one hit is within tactical knife range. Even then I've had hitmarkers with them using damage proficiency at point blank range despite my entire crosshair being over their torso. Takes three 12 gauge shotshell rounds to kill someone at 10m but only three 9mm pistol rounds at the same range -> Sledgehammer games logic.

-Overpowered guns: Akimbo FMG's can and will snipe you from halfway across the map, not just once but multiple times. Obviously because 9mm rounds are just that powerful and accurate. Dunno why they decided to make guns so d@mn powerful in this game. Type 95 is also another classic... not used as often since the follow up bursts are slow but you really need only 1 burst at close to medium range. Yes, Infinity Ward... a 5.8mm chinese round from a Type 95 has more damage than a 7.62x51mm NATO round from a CM901. Makes sense. Oh and ACR 6.8 and MP7... don't even get me started. They render half the assault rifles and submachine guns useless. Anyone who uses any of the above guns really isn't interested in playing the game for fun.

-Spawns. Are really bad. Every match I spawn in front of an enemy at least two times.

-Killstreaks. Are really, really overpowered. If the enemy has a UAV missile drone/chopper/AC-130/Osprey gunner it's pretty much over.

-Matchmaking system. If you leave a room because the map sucked or there was a hacker, chances are, if you pick the same mode, you'll be put into that same room again. Like seriously?

-No votekick. If there's a hacker in the room, best bet is to report him through steam and then leave and pick another game mode to play.

Don't buy this game. Wait for black ops 2. I heard they're actually using new guns and a decent map system plus dedicated servers.

Holt,"It is very difficult to rate this game - as a lifelong fan of Tolkien I want to lavish praise, because the subject matter is strong, the atmospheres match up perfectly to those that I imagined in the book, and the plot is followed rather faithfully.  However, as a video game, it doesn't translate into more than a few hours of suspenseful, challenging fun - though I thoroughly enjoyed my trip through Middle Earth in this game.
The best thing about this game is the way it captures the feeling of the books - the colorful, pastoral hills of the Shire, the foggy darkness of the Barrow Downs, and the beautifully-rendered underworld of Moria, which was probably the highlight of the game for me.  It uses the same basic engine as Drakan to create vast landscapes and assign 'side quests' at various points, though there is little choice in what path you take, as you must follow the plot of the book for the most part.  The music is varied, atmospheric and nice, and the controls are fairly basic and easy to master, making gameplay progress smoothly.
Fans of the books will love the opportunity to become immersed in the world of Middle Earth.  Most gamers will progress very quickly through the levels, though the very beginning presented some tedious quests and one challenge that was so frustrating and seemingly impossible I almost gave up, until I got the hang of ""sneaking.""  I also found the lack of a detailed map to be very frustrating, as you cannot zoom in on the area you are exploring to get a handle on your direction.
If you are renting this casually, and are not deeply into the world of Tolkien, it may not be worth the steep purchase price.  For one thing, there is virtually nothing for the characters to pick up in the game other than health.  There are no additional weapons or items to collect and not a lot of opportunity for advancement in skill.  You switch between Frodo, Aragorn and Gandalf at various points in the game as the plot dictates, but the player has no control over which character is in play.  It might have been interesting to choose between them, giving the game three possible outcomes, but as it stands, there is little replay value unless you want to wander through this dark and beautiful world performing the same actions each time.

That said, what we have today, two years later, is a wonderful game built in the spirit of the original...that is still dogged by problems that it shouldn't have.

Diablo III has taken the very best elements of the previous games and fused them into a package that is fun to play, simple to use, and yet rich with options.  Want to customize your character?  Collect unique items?  Collect components and craft your own items?  You can do all those things, or you can just pick up a game and run through the story.  The writing is deep, with many different characters wandering in and out of the story.  Some of them you can add to your group, and you get to choose which you prefer to work with (and to some extent control their skills and equipment).  We have a story set in the same world but continuing the events of the first two games.  Just like its predecessors, the story of Diablo III is broken up into Acts, like a play, and each has a well-built story with some pretty cool cutscenes and dialogue matched to the character you choose.  I found it fun to play through and listen to the dialogue, and I also enjoyed wandering off the beaten path and picking up various side quests.  The levels look beautiful and the way you can mix and match your skills on the fly is excellent.

Some examples of how gameplay is streamlined:
- no more having to watch your mana potions:  mana refills automatically, no potions necessary, and you can improve the refill rate through your choice of equipment.  Health also recovers automatically, but you can still save yourself in a pinch with health potions.
- the skill tree lets you play around, switching to different skillsets.  As you level, old skills can get new boosts that make them different and interesting
- no more Scroll of Town Portal!  Just tap the 'T' key to return to town and sell your stuff
- the 'Stash' chest of things you don't need but don't want to get rid of is large, and you can buy more slots with the gold you loot
- the crafting system is interesting and lets you 'level up' the Blacksmith to make higher-level items for you.  You can also find 'recipies' and transmogrifications for modifying items and the components come from 'Salvaging' items to produce raw materials for crafting.
- Stash and Crafting are player-specific, meaning that if you play through as one character, the same stash appears for any other characters to rummage through--so save loot that you might think would come in handy on another playthrough.  If you leveled up the Blacksmith or Gem Merchant, they stay at that rank.  And all the gold you earned is in one lump for any character to use.
- you don't always have to wander through every step of a map multiple times:  waypoints are fairly generous.

Unfortunately, Blizzard caused quite an uproar when they announced that Diablo III requires a continuous Internet connection.  Even if you're playing Single Player, you'll need to be logged in to your Blizzard account via the game launcher in order to play the game--and if you get disconnected, you'll lose some of your progress.  Playing co-op online is really easy now, but the problem is that without that choice to play offline, we now have a single-player game that is dogged by the kinds of problems MMOs have had for the last 10 years, including the memorable first days of World of Warcraft when you'd see ""the wait time to play is X minutes"".  There are times the game will lag and then 'catch up' with itself, making the action hiccup.  I've had rubber-banding, delayed responses, and dialog running over itself because there was a hitch in my connection to Blizzard's servers (note:  I've got a fantastic home network).  I quickly disabled all the chat options because I was getting global spam from gold traders and power-levelers offering to play your game for you.

It can be frustrating to have a local game behave like it's being streamed to you from a server, and if this were a multiplayer problem I'd understand...but I should be able to play single-player without feeling like I'm instanced alongside a bunch of other people and we're all sharing bandwidth.  Sometimes I get 'wait time is 15 minutes' and 15 minutes later my connection is timed out, my ID/password are wiped from the login blanks and I have to log in again...only to be dropped back into the wait queue.  You'd think that one of the largest MMO companies on the planet, that manages ten million users worldwide, would have the ability to let single-player users log in to their servers without overloading them.

If you're a fan of the prior Diablo games, it would be hard not to absolutely love this game.  I do truly enjoy playing it for the same 'feel' that the older titles gave me.

Pros:
- Graphics are quite good as well as sound effects.
- Entertaining maps.
- Interesting concept, almost like playing against or as a boss monster in every round.
- Unique hunter skill sets.
- Ability to play as a monster or hunter.

Cons:
- Monster POV is frustrating.
- Best play is co-op, but opportunities of having your own team/friends to do this are small.
- Play gets repetitive.
- Awfully noisy, especially solo. Lots of character shouts, multiple weapons going on, monsters screaming. After a while, it sounds like you've put your head in a trash compactor and it won't stop.

All in all, I'd quantify it as a good, but not great game.  Not yet at any rate.  My biggest beef is with the monster POV.  Hard to tell when to jump, when to climb because it is difficult to judge distances, and more often than not, I'd find my monster facing a wall when I tried to use one of the special attacks.

The co-op portion is frustrating. I won't play co-op games unless I'm with people I know because what you get off the servers is 99 times out of 100, some 12 year old foul-mouthed kid who thinks they know everything. So this being a new (and expensive) game, means that co-op opportunities for me are going to be little to none until my friends slowly pick up the game as the price drops.  BUT...if you can get a group together, it's a very entertaining co-op.

So solo - I give the game 3 stars, co-op with friends I give it 4 stars, for an average of 3.5 stars.

This is an open ended RPG game meaning there is no well defined plot. It is large, but sparsely populated with anything interesting. You spend most of your time walking around either at either a slow or very slow pace.
Graphics are very much like Heretic II except they run VERY slowly (around 5-6 fps). Collisions and crashes are very common. Fortunately quicksave is fast. Sound is good and some of the weather special effects are good too.
The user interface is abysmal - two examples.
1. There are 9 seperate steps required to open a locked door with a lockpick. You know the door is locked, you know I have a lockpick, why can't you assume I'm going to use it when I click on the door?????
2. The same button (space) is used to talk to a person and to take an object. At one point instead of talking to someone I accidently took the vase in front of them and got attacked by everyone in the room as a thief! Stupid design!
You'll run into a large number of NPCs in this game who are uniformly and identically rude event when you're doing them a favor. It's boring and annoying.
In summary, this game is like writing your Phd thesis during a thunderstorm. Rather tedious and you'll want to save your work frequently.

It is merely a way for Nintendo to show off the DS's unique cababilities. When I popped this into my DS I expected a new chapter in the Yoshi/Mario story, but as I soon found out there was no story, bosses, or anything of that nature just the same actions in different variations. This action I describe begins with Baby Mario falling through the sky as you guide him down, avoiding enemies and collecting coins as you do so. Once you hit the ground Baby mario gets on Yoshi's back where you kill/eat enemies and collect coins to get the high score at the end. While this is fun for a bit, it gets tiresome. The multiplayer is skimpy and not really worth going over. This game would have been great as a freebie thrown in with the DS seeing how it shows both touch screen and dual screen capabilities but it was instead released as a regular $30 game.

3.0,False,"01 6, 2006",A3LRIXA76RTRDE,B0002B90SA,John Moscarelli,"First of all, the first KOTOR was an excellent game and I enjoyed it a lot. It was unlike any other game and it was the first of the star wars games where you can choose your path. The second one however wasn't anywhere near as good as the first. It lacked in many things and it seemed as if Lucas arts didn't put any effort into the game and they just decided to throw another KOTOR out there because the first one made a lot of money. This isn't too surprising because lucas arts has done this many times, they arn't too well of a game creating company.

  KOTOR 2 is not a horrible game, but don't think it is any better than the first or even as good. The fact that you are already a jedi is cool but its like you don't get a lightaber for a while, and you don't just get one, you have to find the things to make it so it can even take longer than the first. The STORY LINE is horrible and it makes the game really boring. The first had a great story line, but this one is bad. It just sort of throws you out there and its almost a repeat of the first. Like the first the storly line has you specially connect with another jedi I got bored of this fact and the story line has no specific objectives. It is just basically kill one master jedi on each planet. And you get confused because you can just leave and fly to any planet without doing the objective so then you get lost and you can think you're done with a planet but you really aren't and you start wondering what you still have to do to beat the game. The story line also keeps you confused by having you not know a lot of things that happened in the past because it isn't a continuation of the first. Its like you don't know what gooing on through the whole game.

  The gameplay is basically the same thing as the first and has nearly no differences. The wierd thing is that your party members also follow you to whichever path you take. And say you choose to go to the darkside, when you do something bad like kill someone good your party members always ask why they went with the flow. And its like everytime, it got really annoying. The game also tends to slow down and freeze for a second or two during the play. The worst with that situation is the menu. When you hit pause it takes a second to get there and when you switch to a different option in the menu it stalls for a second.

  The graphics are a little bit better than the first not a lot though. The graphics are probably a real low in this game because all the other games during this time have good graphics, but the graphics for this game are like 2 years ago. And the game has rarely any cinematechs and all they are are your ship flying to a different planet or going into hyperspace.

  The game does have some good points like the new force powers you get and the game still has that cool feeling of turning to the darkside and choosing your path like you really are a jedi. There is a problem with the whole fact of the changing sides thing though. Its like if you turn to the darkside you really aren't joining any sith in the game, you just make your own side sort of. Its like you turn to the darkside and you're evil but the sith still want you dead and they still fight you and you still want to kill them and the jedi are still like on your side even when you're evil.

  Overall the game is very boring and the one thing RPG games need is an excellent story line and this one does not at all. And the game feels more like an unfinished game. If you have the first and want more, i still recommend this game but don't get your hopes up for it being as good as the first.

3.0,False,"05 12, 2011",AF70O6UDVJQ2D,B001NX4DUQ,Mike,"First this game is hard. Not in an unbeatable way just in a way that will challenge you. If you die a certain number of times the game reminds you that you can lower the difficulty level at any time. Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry do similar things. However, when entering an area with low health and dying repeatedly (I'd guess about 4-5 times) the game automatically refills your health meter the next time you load into the area after death.

As a gamer who gets frustrated at the difficulty of games and then gets the satisfaction of overcoming those difficulties, it enrages me to no end that the developer would do something like that. It's the equivalent to saying in a condescending voice ""Having a problem there? Well here you go big guy, I've made it a little easier for you."" Whether the game lowers the difficulty or gives the user an advantage after many deaths should always be up to the user to accept. I don't need someone to ""take pity on me.""

Second. Do not break game functions to make the game harder.
First example is a puzzle in the Greed level. Dante must pull a lever that causes a spiked gate to rise and then fall rapidly. As it rises it reveals a doorway that he must jump through before the gate falls causing instant death. (All of this is totally fine) I actually thought this was going to be an easy puzzle. I pulled the lever and did ""dash"" forward. (Tapping the Right Stick causes dante to dash quickly in the direction to push it.) I made it to the ledge with time to spare and jumped. He didn't grab the ledge. I jumped again, and again he refused to grab the ledge. The gate came down and I died. I did this several more times before I decide to run toward the ledge instead of dashing toward it. I barely had anytime but he GRABBED the ledge on his first jump.

So it seems that the devs, decided to break dante's auto-ledge-grab if the user dashes toward the cliff. The only reason I can think of is as a cheap way of increasing the difficulty.

This game has a good sense of design. Not just in the characters but in the levels and just how the game looks.

The first difference is the graphics, and they are much better then the days of old, but unless you zoom in, they look little different then most space RTS that have come out in recent years (namely Dawn of War I and II).

The second major difference is the campaign mode. The interface and story telling mechanics are much more detailed, engrossing, and overall better.

The similarities are where the infuriation comes in however. The game plays online, and off, exaclty like the old game. fend off a zerg rush and build, gather resources and build, and repeat. My great problem with the game is a sense of deja-vu that I've done it all before, and if fact, I have. Some new units help the equation, but in essence the new units meerly replace old ones that were removed, and don't greatly change the gameplay.

If you're looking for a jaw-dropping RPG that will leave you addicted, get Final Fantasy X (at the nice new rate of twenty bucks a pop).  If you've already beaten that twice, then get Xenosaga.
All the good elements are there: it's a (sort of) FF style RPG with nice graphics.  The main hook for me was the story.  The cutscenes were incredibly long.  But it didn't matter, because most of them were riveting, and sometimes frankly creepy (i.e. Albedo ripping his own head off and laughing).  Presented in beautiful anime-style 3-D CG graphics, the story that begins to unfold is gripping, and filled with many more-than-subtle refrences to different religions and philosiphies.  Love it.
But as for why it takes sixty long hours:
The gameplay is unbalanced.  Damage is dealt through special attacks, but though they are asthetically different, they all end up becoming 'short-range attack' for 'enemy on ground' and 'long-range attack' for 'enemy in air'.  This deceptively simple system would lend itself to fast battles, but the solidly turn-based fight system drags itself along like a fallen tree sloth.  Magic (called ether) is used, but rarely for anything other than healing, making your magic-user essentially useless once you transfer her skills to someone with more HP.
In contrast to the battle system, leveling up is hard, time-consuming and complex.  Seems that seperate points are required for each of three types of attribute, and these are critical if you want to survive.
Areas.  Way too few, way too big, way too overused.  You only get about seven or eight main areas during the game, and over half can be summed up as gray ship walls with red spots, or red ship walls with gray spots.
Enemies.  Too few types.  Stupid, predictable, and too easy to avoid, giving rise to the temptation to not train at all.  And they award so few points and gold that over half your time is spent killing the exact same enemies.  Blahzzzzzzzzz...
Music.  It rocks the first time you hear it.  And the second, and even the fifth.  But when you hear the exact same seven tired tunes forty hours into the game, you don't care that the London Philharmonic performed them.
All in all, the bad elements can be summed up in one word: repitition.  The boys (and girls) up at Namco spent all their creativity on the plot.  My personal suggestion: $%#@ the game, edit the CG sequences together and add in a few more, and release it in theaters.  It'd be great.

First though, if you do buy this, here is something I wish was clearer. Do not play each mission purely goal oriented. If you rush through to the goal, you'll be missing what was intended as the most rewarding game play. You should explore each mission area entirely. You'll find things of use to you well beyond that particular level, as well as interesting asides.

As to the game itself, here's the good and the not so good.

Good: Incredible graphics. Nice balance of hard and easy in how you do things. Some interesting gameplay.

Bad: Overall lack of variation. The levels seem repetitive and not nearly as dynamic and different from one another as the first game (remember the brothel? And the brewery?). And, although on the face of things, it looks like you have as many options about how you play as in the first game, there is a problem with the stealth feature. First, adversaries seem able to see you around corners, a mile away, on top of a building, and generally ... anywhere. Even if you're sneaking, sound can give you away. And the movement and clusters of adversaries gives you little chance for one-and-done stealth attacks as the first game did. You simply can't weed them out like you could in the first game.

which isn't saying much but, it's true

the gameplay is effected negatively by the controls
you do get a lot of content in this package though (between the massive Story broke up into  Episodes (much like TellTale games  has been doing for the past couple of years
you also get the old RE 4 Bonus The Mercenaries Mode  (which is awesome and fun and worth picking this game up on just for)

Graphics/Audio
This game is a straight-up port of the 360 version it's by far one of the ugliest looking XBOne titles (On Disc) you can own
It looks washed out it's ugly! the only major difference between this version and the 360 version is the draw distance
If you want a pretty looking Resident Evil title get the Remastered version released last winter ondemand
the audio is the strongest thing about this port due to the XBOne function being able to decode

It sounds kind of contradicting me saying this game is redundant, but I liked the aforementioned games because of The Koopalings.

But it was still a very good  introduction to the system for me.  I learned about magic and lore and the  differences between a ghoul and a vampire and a human.
The main  character, Christof, was very interesting to play.  My first nervous twinge  about playing a vampire themes games was ""Ew... so I'm going to play a  bloodthirsty commando?"" but as I progressed through the chapters I  found that I was in control of my own destiny.  I could try to be kind and  just or I could be as  cruel a jerk as I wanted.
There were some  annoyances like the lack of saves and the utter confusion of combat and  lack of tactics (You pretty much just mobbed a monster with everything you  had and hoped it was enough) but I've heard that this will change soon with  a patch.
The game progresses from the days of the crusades to modern  times.  I didn't care much for the time jump (It would have been much  cooler to slowly progress through time to modern ages) but that might have  made the game ten times longer that it was, so that's just a small  gripe.
The characters of Christof, the holy knight turned Vampire, and  his love Anezka, whom he searches for out of guilt and out of love are  wonderfuly done and made the story more real.  The dialogue was well  written and made up for the messily done hack and slash fests one must take  to progress through each level.
Another really great feature is the  multiplayer capabilities.  One of the things that makes it so great is that  a person has the option to be a game master in an adventure and control  just about everything.  It's really great to be able to craft your own  games and so far this has been the first one I've ever seen with this  option instead of running Quake-like through a maze and killing everybody  in sight.
Overall there were some innovative options in this game and it  was well put together, just the combat was a little confusing at times and  the lack of saving points made it difficult.  Still, I think that the good  points outweigh the bad.",Not a bad buy,965260800,3,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

The 1994-95 team is there too and it is still missing the bench players like Brooks Thompson.  It is also not possible to select the O-rena as the home court for any other team except the 1994-95 team, so the current squad would have to play in Amway Center.  They have the 1989 retroes and the 2003 retroes but not the TMac ones.  There is a create your own shoe mode in there and supposedly you can upload the shoe and Nike will make it for you.  I dunno about that one but I guess that's in there.

I played one exhibition game as the current Magic and I did not play Duhon and Ish SMith was on default injured list so I had the three guard lineup of Jameer, Afflalo and JJ.  I had Harrington come off the bench and he popped in 6 threes and 28 points.  Hedo was on fire too with 8 threes and Redick had 7 threes for a total of 21, in 8 minute quarters.

There is a ""celebrity game"" in there and I dunno if those people have correct heights and skills.  The roster included luminaries such as Justin Bieber and Sean Kingston.  I dunno if Bieber is really 6-4 and if so, they had him as a Michael Redd style shooter complete with the lefty motion and can dunk on people.

The big complaint I have about the game is the standalone coop mode, which they really could have made better. In other Tom Clancy games, you were able to utilize Persistent Character Creation, but not in this case. You have to take the weapons they give you at the start of each round, and you don't get to change your character or customize loadouts in this game mode, only in competitive multiplayer. But what really bothers me about it, is that you have to ""defend"" a location that really limits your mobility and just cuts down on the fun. They have implemented it poorly.

I am not disappointed just was left with the feeling there should have been more and I'm sure most of us wanted more. I bought this on the 22nd of march
as of this writing it's april 12th (my old ps3 died and thus the delay)
the graphics aren't Improved so much as Cleaned up and the game even jests
about the ""muddy browns of ferelden"".
the camios by DA:O Characters are a very nice addition as well as a special trophy for loading your old DA: Origins save and letting this effect your plotline (you may select from several preset plotlines or go it from scratch)
the character customization felt rather pointless here since I was Forced to play a specific character I figured Might as well leave him alone and skipped customizing him (you do get a decent amount of freedom though)
the class I played through was Warrior and I had a good time BUT at no time did it ever feel as Epic as Dragon Age: Origins did. it felt lifeless and the reused environments do get dull after a while and this coming from a dragon age nut!
I should say, those looking for more darkspawn slaughter might want to rent first. the primary enemy type seems to be a rogue/assasin/templar which is the same character model for all three. the rest such as the returning Rage Demons you'll not see until about halfway through the game.
I am not really sure what my story line did from Dragon Age Origins
to Dragon Age II (though I've only played through Once just did Both endings while I was there lol)
except for the trophy (which is a gold so I'm good)
the ""new"" hack & slash style combat is not what I prefer. I do love hack & slash games (such as diabloII)
but this seems a setback for the franchise. I really like what the game got right and most of what it does wrong didn't bother me much Except the combat.
the animations are very fast and hard to see at times, the mage animations are really excellent though. overall the ending is Not epic and you'll not even figure out whom the main antagonist is, until over halfway through the game and you will do A Lot of fetch quests. also if you miss a single resource and time passes (three years pass at a certain point in the game)
it's gone and you will have to play through again for the crafter trophy (Ugh!)
Overall a solid RPG that never needed fixing just More added to it!

Graphics: much cleaner and more vibrant 4 of 5 stars

Gameplay: ugh the new fighting style you'll love or hate. 2 of 5 stars

Sound/Voice Acting: as usual Bioware delivers with all camios delivered by the original actors and the battles sound good (when not too clangy)

If I would have known this before I would have waited for this game to drop to $19.99 or lower. After playing this game since release the levels are very limited with restriction compared to the 1st Crysis. I find the game does need a patch to fix encountered bugs through out the game. I found enemy soliders stuck in corners of the levels and not moving just bouncing around and yelling out taunts back and forth like a pinball. The A.I. of the enemy soliders are also not as aggressive like in the original Crysis. I read a recent article that a Direct x11 patch for the pc is in the works. I hope they decide to fix the bugs this game has also. The save system in this game will drive you crazy. There are save points in the game. Unless you get to another save point and get killed on a certain part of the level without reaching the save point you must start all over again. In the original Crysis you could save anytime you wanted within the game. This game also has limited activations and uses solidshield giving you 5 activations per computer. When you uninstall the game you need to deauthorize the install to get your activation back. If you are pc gamer that likes to upgrade your computer alot this could be a problem. Why not just let the game do an activation over the internet after an install with unlimited activations. After paying for the game why should the buyer be bothered with limited rental game play. If you have a PC and have not played the original Crysis on the PC then do yourself a favor and pick up a new or used copy of the original Crysis by itself not the Crysis Maximum Edition. The 1st game has no DRM problems or forces you to be linked to a 2nd account and allows you to install the game as much as you want.

Having found the travel-sized version at a swap meet (tucked in with a copy of Professor Layton, basically getting 2 game for the price of one), it remains my first true exposure to Zelda.

Before long, I was learning the ins and outs of every game that would follow; getting that wooden sword, cutting down foes and bushes, collecting rupees towards the purchase of healing potions and bombs, hoarding vital items and upgrades, exploring dangerous dungeons, and preparing for the final showdown with the Big Bad in order to rescue the princess.  And harassing harmless chickens.

A central feature to LTTP is a magic mirror enabling Link to travel between the world of light and darkness--as a bunny.  Though the player eventually acquires an item that solves this problem, there are still traps that bypass the desired effects, and temporarily turn Link into a vulnerable bunny.  And unlike the Oracle games, one cannot come and go as he/she pleases; to travel from the Light World to the Dark World, the player must go back to the point from which he/she warped.  In terms of sound, the music and effects are outstanding, if you don't mind hearing the same 3 tracks through the majority of the game.

To its credit, the other items available throughout LTTP makes the journey a lot easier, such as an ocarina that signals a bird to fly you to different areas in Light World, along with 3 hidden medallions that attack multiple enemies.  In the graphics department, LTTP looks exactly as it does in the Super NES version, and those Dorkly parody videos.  My one complaint is that the dungeon maps are so small compared to the SNES version.

I can't really complain about the other game in the cartridge, though.  Actually, I can't say anything about Four Swords as it requires 2-4 people with their own GBA's and their own copies of Zelda to play it.

At the time, I didn't have a PC powerful enoug to play the PC version, being mainly a console gamer.  So I picked up the game after reading some rave reviews.
  First of all, if you have never played games like Sierra's King's Quest, Space Quest, or any of the Monkey Island series, then go purchase this game.  It is hilarious, if in a cheesy kind of way, and contains joke after pun after slapstick.  It is extremely well written and a good, involving story.
  The graphics are impressive with cartoon-style characters and painted backdrops.  Everything is fluid and load times aren't bad at all.  All characters seem like they are out of a Disney movie, and many are re-appearing from the previous installments of the series on the PC.  Speaking of which, your really do not need to have played the other games to understand what is going on.
  This game is good as a way to tell a story, with a couple mini-games thrown in.  Overall, you WILL need a hint book or cheat site, because as with most games of this type, the puzzles are completely ludicrous.  There are things you have to do that someone would never normally think of, and with tons of items and characters to interact with, it is next to impossible to merely stumble into doing the correct thing.  There are many many hours of speech that has been put into the game for each character that you come accross, keeping it not too tedious, and the humor definitely helps.
  The gameplay is strong, tried, and true, and the humor.  But overall, if you have played this type from when it first started, it gets very old very quickly.  The jokes carry it still, even after boredom, so only play it a couple hours at a time, and it won't become too tiring.
  So, in closing, if you have never played any point and click adventures, pick this up and get a quick few laughs.  Very well done graphics and sound.  Go pick it up if you can.",Very funny but nothing new,999648000,7,,

The game looks great, sounds great, and generally plays really well, when you consider that it is nothing more than a giant open-world shooter, with very generic missions, very generic enemies, and very generic goals. It would seem the only goals of The Division is to level-up, obtain loot, and ""make your own fun"". It's that last goal that is key -- the game isn't really designed to be fun in any way, it's up to you and your friends to make it so.

Core mission structure is very generic. Go to a location, shoot several waves of enemies, defeat some type of boss. Bosses are bullet sponges. As a single player, some of the bosses will require 25 headshots with a rifle in order to take them down. This isn't fun. If you team-up with your friends, the bosses and enemies level accordingly, so it's just as tedious.

Main story missions are level-locked. There are three types, each with the goal of upgrading your ""base"". Unfortunately, you get to a point where the recommended minimum level for the main story missions are several levels above your current level. Since you'd get decimated trying to complete the mission, your only option is to grind on side-missions until your level either matches or exceeds the recommended minimum level.

Unfortunately, side-missions are just as boring and repetitive as the main story missions. Defend a supply drop, rescue a hostage, take down random bad guys looting in the streets. I could only play an hour at a time before the monotony forced me to turn the game off.

In fact, the city is rather desolate. It's big, it's detailed, but there's hardly anything going on. Where Watch_Dogs was bustling with activity, The Division is a direct polar opposite. There's virtually nothing to do. You'll come across the random looters or enemies, but once you take them out, you can walk blocks before finding something else to do. I honestly don't even think it looks that great. And while many things are destructible, many things are not. You can walk around and close car doors, and car trunks, and shoot car tires (WHY!), but if you shoot a flashing yellow light...you don't destroy it.

The amount of loot, weapons, apparel, etc. that you can acquire is mind boggling and difficult to manage. I did not find the item management system and menus easy to understand or navigate. Like most MMOs, everything is color-coded and leveled. You can scrap items down to components so you can construct other items. You can buy weapons, mods, and upgrades. There's nothing innovative here.

I stopped playing once I reached level 10, and haven't gone back in two weeks.

If you are allured by leveling-up and getting better loot, then this game might satisfy you. If you like playing with friends, and spending hours roaming streets and taking down random enemies, this might be for you. However, I found the environment, missions, and enemies provided to grind to the maximum level of 30 uninspiring. I may eventually go back, in the summer when there are fewer games to play, but I feel I would have to be extremely bored to consider doing do.

3.0,False,"10 20, 2006",A1JSPVBO30TFSE,B0009WPZMW,Brian Seiler,"Burnout gets a lot of credit for its concept.  And, to be fair, that's credit that's deserved.  The idea of a racing game that promotes a powerful sense of speed and encourages the player to hit things (and builds itself around a somewhat realistic prosecution of the aftermath of those collisions) is a good one.  And it leaves its marks all over this game.

Why, then, am I only giving this (to read the other reviews) apparently superb game three stars?  Well, folks--that's simple.  Absolutely every wrong deicision that could have been made with respect to this game has been made, and the end result is a piece of software that has great moments, but can only be considered middling at best.

To start with, the game is about twice as long as it should be, and that's where the problems really set in.  Racing games can be occasionally frustrating.  This game is regularly, unforgivingly frustrating.  In order to effectively ""finish"" the game, you have to perfect every event (there's a LOT of events).  In the beginning, that's pretty easy to do.  Once you reach the middle, you'll probably have five or six events that you have to repeatedly try just to get close to making your perfect rating.  By the end, pretty much all of the racing events fall into that mold.  Worst offenders are the ""Burning Laps"" (time trials), where the game designers seem not only to have assigned some wild and irregular difficulty levels (some tracks you'll get on the first shot; one notable track has taken me three hours to not perfect thus far, and I believe I'm just going to give up on the game as a whole, rather than waste another minute of my life driving the same path again).

All of this, of course, could have been solved if most of the latter half of the game had been left on the drawing boards entirely.  By the time you hit the sixth or seventh rank of events, you've pretty much seen everything the game can do for you as far as race events go.  You've done the Traffic Attack scenarios (where the challenge is basically to go fast and hit cars into oncoming traffic), you've done the Road Rage scenarios (where the challenge is essentially to learn the best places on each track to perform takeouts without injuring yourself), and you've learned all the tricks you're going to learn about general racing and driving.  The additional tracks you have to grind through serve to do nothing but extend and taint the experience of what would otherwise be an enjoyable racer.

The crash events, thankfully, don't have this problem to quite the same extent.  While several of them can be ridiculously and inexplicably frustrating (you may never know why you fail sometimes to get the gold medal in an event and succeed others), that negative element of the experience is at least kept to a comparative minimum.

But the problems - the failures of execution - don't stop with the length of the game.  There are some fundamental programming errors that also plague this title; most notably, the fact that the developers saw fit to attempt to access the disk drive BEFORE saving race result data back to the user's profile.  The result, of course, is that if you have any difficulty at all reading the disc (a smudge, or, in the case of MY 360, some sort of internal defect that causes it to fail reading any game after about an hour and a half), your results will not be saved back to your profile and you will lose any progress you've made in an event.  Add that to the work-intensive, frustrating late game and you have a recipe for disaster.

Games are supposed to be fun.  For the first ten or fifteen hours with this game, I had fun.  You can have fun with it online.  But if you expect to finish this game, you're not going to have fun.  You're going to be bored, you're going to spend a lot of time memorizing and grinding, and ultimately, you're going to end up questioning why you're finishing the game in the first place.

For the price that Amazon has this title for, it's not a bad pickup if you don't have the title on any other console (if you do, you're not gaining much, as this is just a rerelease for 360 with a little bit of extra content).

Also the Story is nicely written, and the Manuscript which acts as a sort of voiced journal for Alan is a nice touch. The atmosphere is very good, creepy and thrilling but not really scary.

 However Its not as good as it could be, first the combat isn't really that fun, it can get boring quickly, this game would have been vastly better if it was heavy on Adventure and light on combat, but at times you can get really zerged by enemies out of nowhere. You probably won't die but its still not that fun, the Flashlight mechanic is a bit iffy too. Also, at least for the first two or so episodes there is NO open world roaming, Im assuming it opens up later but they essentially just keep plopping you down in the forest in the dead of night with tons of enemies. It'd been much more fun if they gave players control of when to do the story missions and let us roam around the town from the get go, but they seem to just force you into the action even if you might not want to.

The game is similar to Super Mario 64, and many tasks should be familiar if you've played that game before.  However, there are many differences that sepperate it from the 1996 classic, Super Mario 64.

I will now list everything about the game outside of what I just said:

__________________________________________________________________________

__________________________________________________________________________

In this game, Mario explores a tropical island trying to fight off many enemies and find his way through obstacles using a water pump called Fludd.  You try to find the shine sprites hidden within each level to strengthen the sunshine of the shine gate.  At the start of the game, only the center of Delfino Plaza is covered in light, but with all the shine sprites, the sunshine is everywhere on the island.

Like Super Mario 64, Mario must collect 120 shiny stary things (Stars in SM64, and shine sprites in Super Mario Sunshine) before the game is completed.  And like Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine forces you to jump into paint and enter different levels with certain tasks.

However, Super Mario 64 does not include Fludd, and Mario must defeat his enemies by punching and kicking them.  Plus, there is definately a bigger ""Mario feel"" in Super Mario 64, as you open blocks and fight off classic Mario enemies instead of running aronud a tropical island, trying to clean up pollution all over the island.

Good Stuff About This Game:

- The graphics are simply amazing in this game.  The color is very precise, and it's very easy to tell the emotion of the characters in the game.  The shapes of objects in the game are accurate and realistic, and the effects and sound aren't terrible, either.

- Cruising through levels is exciting, as you never know what goodies or baddies await you.  It's super fun to ride bloopers, as it is to blast away on water with one of Fludd's nossels.

- The controls in the game are excellent and even better than as in Super Mario 64.  Mario's agility is great, and maneuvering him around the levels is relatively easy.

- Early in the game, it's quite fun to play, since the story is more intense and the levels' tasks are usually fun to play.  Unfortunately, this won't last long.

Bad Stuff About This Game:

- The gameplay of this game is rather cheesy.  So, Mario goes on a vacation and flies to a once sunny island that was polluted by graffiti by someone in a suit that looks like Mario, and the police of the island arrest Mario because they thought it was his fault, so he needs to clean up the island with a pump that shoots water and retrieve shine sprites to make the island sunny again. Pretty unusual compared to other games.  Super Mario 64's objective was sort of weird, as the characters were trapped inside castle walls and Mario must jump into paintings to find the stars to restore the castle's power, but it doesn't come close to Super Mario Sunshine.

- Many of the classic Mario enemies from the past games have been replaced with new ones such as the goomba and pokey.  It would sure feel better to just have the popular enemies in the game instead of ones that act the same but look different.  The only classic Mario enemy to return is the pirahna plant.

- Compared to Super Mario 64, this game is far from humorous.  Almost everything in Super Mario 64 was ridiculously funny, but for some reason, all the humor from Super Mario 64 was removed.  For example, when Mario died from running out of air in Super Mario 64, he covered his mouth gulping up water.  In Super Mario Sunshine, he just rolls over, dead, without even doing anything else.  Overall, I think Super Mario 64 is humorous, but Super Mario Sunshine is just more annoying.

- By the time you make it to Noki Bay, it's likely you'll end up stuck, since the Manta Storm level in Sirena Beach, the previous level, must be completed before any other tasks can, and that task is extremely difficult for how early the game is.  I just don't get the second task on Noki Bay, and haven't gotten any farther.  I've played this game over and over again, and always stopped playing my game once I got to Sirena Beach or Noki Bay, and never beat the Manta Storm.  Do not buy this game without buying an instruction guide for it first.

First, the AI of your team is completely moronic; meanwhile, your opponents AI is much better, and they can easily gun down your crew.  Several times when facing opponents, your team lies in direct line of fire, and even worse, let the opponents come close and either knock them out or throw a grenade.  Ghost Recon (XBox version) is much better.  Next, with the maps at the Briefing screen, you should be able to direct Bravo to move and cover various positions using waypoints of your own.  Third, there are cheap glitches in game.  In mission 10, the Hind that you are supposed to be attacking actually hides from you, and you are forced to stand in the open to fire at the chopper and will be slaughtered.  Every single time!

You can't zoom or rotate the gallery shots of the mecha, which is disappointing - but hardly a gameplay issue.

The Duels now have you play that frakkin ""Hit triangle, square, circle, x"" game, which I really suck at.  This seems to break up the play, just as you are closing with a boss.

The game should have had at least twelve missions to play in it to be called a full version game. This game is suppose to be a full version game. Not a add-on or an expansion game. I feel like I have been ripped off by someone.

Of the six missions, only the first four missions honor the brave soldiers that fought in World War II. The last two missions do not honor the brave soldiers who fought during World War II. The last two missions are fantasy made missions that remind me of going to amusement park. You have super Nazi's in the last two missions that take forever to kill. Shoot them in the head or blow them up with grenades it doesn't do any good. It takes at least fifty to a hundred shots with your weapon to take down one of these super Nazi's. I felt like I needed to find a super weapon like a laser gun to bring them down.

I notice in the fifth mission (Operation Varsity) there are railroad cars that are not European made rail cars. They are North American made railroad cars. What is up with that? It is quite obvious that somebody just slapped some North American railroad cars into the mission just to finish it.

In the last mission, (Operation Der Flakturm) American paratroopers land on a German Flak tower in Germany right after Operation Varsity. This mission never took place during World War II. The Russians were the only ones to assault German Flak towers during the war. In fact, the Flak tower used in the game never even got built in Germany. There was three generations of Flak towers built by the Germans during the war and only the first two generations of towers were built in Germany. Those towers were built in the German cities of Berlin and Hamburg during the war. The game shows a third generation built Flak tower built in Germany, that was actually built in Vienna, Austria during the war. Somebody screwed up.

It almost seems like two different teams of game developers work on the Medal of Honor Airborne game. One team worked on the first four missions of the game which were realistic and actually happen during World War II while another team worked on the last two missions in the game which are more sci-fi and fantasy. I really wanted to like this game because I'm a big World War II fan. With all the actual events that happen during World War II, why would the game developer need to makeup any missions for the game?

This another example of a game that should of went somewhere that ended up going nowhere.

3.0,False,"01 18, 2010",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B000XJLQ24,Raul G.,"I really wanted to like Brutal Legend. After all Tim Schafer is one of the industries best known storytellers. Sadly after finishing the game my conclusion is that Brutal Legend is more hype than substance and more filler than unforgettable experience.

There is undoubtedly some fun to be had in this game. Brutal Legend is and odd mixture of open-world exploration coupled with Real Time Strategy elements known as ""stage battles"". The voice work headed by Jack Black is top-notch. As is the heavy metal soundtrack. I'm a bit torn whether to categorize the graphics as merely passable or the stuff of last-generation. For sure the graphics are nothing revolutionary. Though the art-style itself is great and the world of Brutal Legend is imaginative.

Unfortunately the curious choices by Schafer & company to make Brutal Legend an open-world game ultimately harm the game more than adding to it. So much of this title is filler. Pointless side-quests that have you driving all over the world map to do a certain chore. The main storyline itself can probably be completed in 4-5 hours so I suspect the side-quests are mainly included to pad the game a bit.

Another curious element are the stage battles. These are RTS battles where you must build up and army of various units to attack an opposing army. The goal is to ultimately destroy the other army's stage itself. To say that these battles are out of place is an understatement. RTS games have never really found a comfortable home on consoles for a reason - mainly the control interface. Brutal Legend's RTS battles are no exception. The battles are awkward thanks to clumsy controls and a sluggish camera. The disjointed and unbalanced armies add to the frustration. Unfortunately there are several of these battles scattered around the storyline.

I was really hoping for a story driven, stylized game in Brutal Legend - the types of games Tim Schafer is known for. Unfortunately what I got was a game that would be more suitable in 2004 than in 2009.

3.0,False,"02 16, 2010",A15F7ACDRTWXO1,B0016BVYAM,Chutzpuh,"Bioshock 2 comes off as little more than extra content rather than a full on sequel to the first.  Basically, the story continues 10 years after the events of the first with the protagonist being one of the hulking ""Big Daddies"" you so loved.

In the end, the story is simply not as good.  It could be that the first one had a character you could almost relate to, for a while at least.  The city of Rapture was new and interesting.  As you learned the history of the city, you started to piece together an underlying plot to it all that became something very good and sinister by the end.  In this one, you play as a character that you really don't care about.  I just never felt myself getting into it at all.

Bioshock didn't hit game of the year for any reason other than creativity and story.  Unimpressive graphics, sound, control, exploration, nothing amazing there.  The second had little to work with, and it didn't even use what it had well.

Enough with history though, I'll try to lay out what impressed and did not impress me.

Graphics:
Nothing new here.  Looks exactly the same as the first.  The water looks nice, but you can see the sharp edges on the shores and you can see how non-dynamic and 2d everything really is.  Bioshock couldn't compare with the games of the time (Crysis, Timeshift) and it still doesn't years later.  If you are looking for some nice eye candy, it won't be in here.

Gameplay:
Control is nothing new here.  Move around with the keyboard, point with the mouse.  Works well enough for me, and I still prefer it over a controller.  The biggest issue that I hated here was the killing of quick save and quick load.  I never used the respawn chambers of the first game, with a quick load there was no need.  Take 2 must have noticed this and broke that aspect of play.  More likely though, this is an Xbox port and they simply never added that function.  After all, your escape menu is still referred to as the ""Pause"" menu.  Other obvious carryovers from the console are still evident as well.

I wasn't happy with the new weapons here either.  No pistol, just the rivet gun instead.  Takes about 5 shots to take something down with it and it doesn't aim well.  No machine gun, you get a gatling gun looking thing instead, that is somehow weak and horribly inaccurate.  Many portions of the game require you to hold an area against a flood of enemies, but the lack of good powers and weapons as well as near useless traps you set makes this a terrible chore to go through every time.

Install:
I usually dislike talking about DRM in reviews, I leave that to the other few thousand people here.  While Windows Live is about as broken as Steam, it isn't as invasive as other options out there.  One good aspect here, you can actually play single player without creating an account and doing that little activation dance.  Unlike Steam, you can make a remote account and handle everything on your computer.  Makes me wonder what the point of this DRM is if they practically built in a work-around.

This is good for me since most of my gaming these days is done on the go with a laptop.  Internet is not always there and having to try to connect to play single player is a painful and spiteful chore.

Multiplayer:
Broken and bad.  If you ever tried the MW2 pc multiplayer, well just think of that.  No options, slow, painful and ends for no reason.  Don't expect to get anything multiplayer for your money here.

Conclusion:
In the end, I can't give more than 3 stars for this lackluster performance.  For everything here, Take 2 should have released this a month after the first as an expansion.  The story is unimpressive, the graphics scales with what I expect from 3 years ago and while some of the mini-games (hacking) have changed to be faster and less invasive, most of the other gameplay was broken in the trade-off.  If quick save and quick load are taken away, something better than the re-spawn chamber needs to be used.  Even the simple checkpoint system of Halo is preferable.  Even a timed autosave would be nice rather than a save at the start of each area (aside from the manual open the menu and save one).

First person/third person camera toggle. Having the option to go third-person helps make this feel less like Battlefield and more like Star Wars: Battlefront.
Fun if repetitive gameplay, at least online. Having bad internet and no gold membership, I haven't been able to play multiplayer yet.
Hero/Villain mode. Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and the others are VERY fulfilling to play as, and this alone gives me a New Hope for future Star Wars games.
Cons
Repetitive gameplay, as I mentioned. Not much in the way of variety of weapon-types and class types, at least not like the classic Battlefront games.
Doesn't feel like Battlefront. Gameplay style is barely similar at all. Not even a single sound effect from the old games.
Not offline-friendly. No campaign mode, no beloved Galactic Conquest, and only a few missions on the same four maps.

I read reveiws before buying it, but figured for $20 the problems people consistently mentioned couldn't be THAT bad. So, I got this game for my girlfriend who loves the show. I like the show enough that a game based on it interested me.

Good news: The story and dialogue are exactly what a Buffy fan would want from a Buffy game. The ability to play as Sid is great -- except that it only lasts one level. I liked playing as different characters, since playing as Buffy got repetative.

Bad news: The game uses backtracking to increase the amount of time you spend playing. By the zoo level, we lost our patience and found a walkthrough online. I guess we were supposed to know that we had to grab the top of an automatic fence as it lifts up to get to the other side of a room??? Yes, my girlfriend and I got a cheap thrill by 'beating' the game by cheating. By that point we were tired of the game's poor camera and ditzy fighting engine, which makes the game approach 'unplayable' at certain points. In fact, the camera is so disfunctional that it prevents you from even using the many fighting moves that the characters all have. Since the camera was always changing, so were the directions I was supposed to be pushing on the stick.... And don't even get me started about trying to use an item in the middle of a fight -- scrolling thru the inventory while being punched in the head by toothy, spikey demons is as hard -- and annoying -- as it sounds.

It had more positive reviews than bad and I was really craving a football game to play. Well after 3 days with the game I am going to sell it and pick up another copy of All Pro Football 2k8 because that is a football game that gets gameplay down right.

First thing I noticed and what actually made me happy was no online pass code. EA has said they will no longer do this and I am grateful they decided not to use the shady tactic again. So online for everybody. The first disappointing thing I noticed was no EA Trax. That means there isn't really music from artists but instead in the menus we just have epic football music playing constantly. Probably not a big deal to some but I was looking forward to seeing what music would be in the game this year.

So the main problem I had with this game is the gameplay and it is still broken. You still can't challenge plays so if you feel cheated out of a play, ""deal with it bro"" seems to be the games attitude. I can't tell you how many times I am playing defense and the ball carrier runs up to me and I press the B button to switch to the closest guy and then move the right stick or hit the X button to tackle him, and my player dives in the complete opposite direction. It is like the AI had a moment to think for itself and with you pressing that button, the AI freaked out and you go in the wrong way causing more yards to be gained by the other team.

I could talk more about the gameplay but to make a long story short, it just doesn't feel natural at all and the absolute random nature of the gameplay elements and AI, just made the game aggravating for me. For people who don't know what I mean by random elements, well that shows off best in the new drill modes where you practice the new features of the game and get medals for them. In order to get a gold medal, you can only mess the drill up one time. You will soon figure out this is much more easier said than done and the gameplay will just make this a controller breaking mode that will make you never want to jump in that mode again.

Overall, I don't find this game to be fun and all of the features and modes can't mask the poorly designed gameplay. Maybe if people started petitioning and stop buying Madden to make it known world wide, we can get 2K football games again or at the very least, let EA know, something has to be done with this franchise.

3.0,False,"05 8, 2010",A2UP4COAQ7UGBY,B00149ND28,maninblue,"This game is hard to love and hard to hate.  I loved the unique style of the art in the game. This game employs very cool use of color techniques in the art direction.  This adds to what the player sees while moving through the game, but also is true to how the game insinuated that the character has an almost 6th sense for where to go.  For example, certain paths are highlighted in a way in which the character (you) sees a glowing red door or certain wall paint.  This not only looks cool, but also helps point you in the right direction.  It can also get confusing sometimes, because many things are left ambiguous and the correct path would make a normal human being think twice about jumping over a chasm so large.  Instead, you find yourself falling to your death so many times because you either misjudged a gap or went the wrong way because the correct way seemed obviously ridiculous to attempt.  Towards the end of the game, the art direction really pays off and the feeling of the city finally comes alive when they offer a night scene.  Too bad there wasn't more of this.
The music is a mix of ambient techno.  This works and fits the futuristic, police state setting of the game very well and can be often catchy. If you want it to be, you can relax, enjoy the scenery, and explore around until you get bored.  The music picks up and slows down depending on what's happening in the game so it all fits.  The other sounds don't really impress so much.  You are always linked to some guy telling you information and he chimes in while you are trying to pull off delicate maneuvers or he calls you and starts talking while you are actively engaged with enemies or frantically scurrying around to escape. I hate when games do that; have conversations when the characters are getting the stuffing kicked out of them.  Much of the story comes through this way and you end up missing out on what the heck is going on because someone just told you their life story while you were tight-rope walking over rooftops with machinegun wielding killing machines chasing you.
I also love the genre of the game: a first-person platformer.  This is a breath of fresh air from the been-there-done-that shooters that saturate the market. It's similar to what would happen if you blended a Prince of Persia-style game with a 1st person shooter, although there is very little shooting to be done on your part.  You are just there to run, jump, and climb around. This is also how the game tends to fail.
You will repeatedly die in this game.  Much of this game requires trial and error to get through this.  You will fall to your death countless times or the G-Men that never stop coming after you will either corner you and shoot you down when you get stuck finding your way around, or beat you up when you try to take them out up close.  So many sections require perfect jumps and cat-like dexterity.  The sad part is that the developers of the game seem like they think that falling to your death hundreds of times and staring at a load screen is great fun.  It is not.  Pulling off the cat-like maneuvers isn't as satisfying as it should be. I was anticipating the game's end which is a first in a long time playing games.  It's pretty frustrating.
The combat in the game is nothing like what it tries to be.  The game's loading screens display a silhouette of your character disarming and taking these guys out with smooth ninja-like motions.  Unfortunately, each time I ran up to a lone enemy, I would have to simply stand there and wait for his gun to turn red before I could press the correct button to snatch it away.  After that, the game takes over and dispatches the enemy for you.  It sounds simple, but the timing has to be perfect and you have to be standing in the correct position in order to pull it off. It's much easier to run up to a lone guy and mash the L2 button until he falls down.
This game has a tendency to seem very lonely.  Sure, you have some guy giving you mission objectives and pieces of story throughout the game and faceless armed killers showing up to gun you down, but you always feel very alone through the whole campaign.  The entire game is an obstacle course, but you never bump into or even see anyone else.  When you crash through a door an some building, you never see office workers jump up in their cubicles to see what's going on or anybody observing you run through any of the games areas.  It would have been nice to include people as another obstacle for you to overcome because it seems to drab otherwise.
Overall, this game was fun, but I had trouble getting addicted to it.  Once I beat the story once, I had no real inclination to play through again if it weren't for the time trials and trophies.  Even then, I am tempted to shelf the game in favor of something a little more engaging.  Because of the low price and the unique style offered here, it is definitely worth a look.

Dislikes: lack of support for Dolby and DTS, SD cards can not be used as system storage (so essentially a useless slot), so-so resolution on game controller screen.

The Wii U has a super innovative controller; not a lot of games out at the moment to take advantage of it but a lot of potential applications as demonstrated in Nintendoland.  Not sure yet if developers will take full advantage of this new technology, I hope so.

I find it a bit suspect that the basic (and delux) pack does not come with a Wii motion controller nor nunchuck.  These are still required in many games, especially THE starter flagship game Nintendoland.

What concerns me most is Nintendo yet again chose to stay well behind the processor power curve.  This game, from what I've read and the few games I've played, has current gen graphics. Sony and Microsoft will be releasing next gen console within the year.  May not seem like a big deal now but in 3-4 years the PS and Xbox games, should, look much better than anything the Wii U will be capable of doing.

The graphics are good, you can customize vehicles, and you should be able to pick up the game in just a few minutes of play.

My main gripe with the game is the mode of play. Unless you use the online multi-player option, you cannot play against someone else. To me, this is the key to any good competition game, being able to play against your friends, family, etc. For this reason, I find this game only average.

Had they gone the whole 9 yards and included head-to-head multi-player functionality, I would consider this game as enjoyable as Grand Theft Auto and the like.

So,for the rest of the undecided here are the best reasons-Relive,Redefine and Rewrite Game modes as well as Legend Killer are challenging and will provide for some fun Gameplay. The Roster of Legends are impressive and the Stages are well done as well as the mini movies in between the Game Modes. One of the best additions to this game is the abilitie to import your SVR Created Characters and some current WWE Superstars. Also,giving created characters attributes is A lot simpler.

However,I'm afraid (if you noticed) I didn't mention Gameplay. That's because the best I can describe it as A broken Arcade circa 1987-type control. If you think for one hot second that this game will have the exact same controls as Smackdown VS. Raw you are very sadly mistaken. Let's start off with the most frustrating things in the game to do-Blocking! You have to hold back against your opponent and press Y,A lot of the time it's unresponsive and when you face another direction you're never quite sure which direction to hold back. This leads to the opponent weakening you enough even if you're dominating and eventually knocking you down and getting A cheap pin and winning the match! It took me A Week to figure out how to Irish Whip someone and even longer to figure out how to get A weapon. This game I swear to you is out to get you at every turn and too bad because the presentation is spot on.

So,it's like giving A wax to wrecked Car. Why?I can not understand why they did not go with the SVR control scheme. It would of make the game perfect,but as it is it's not the best-far from it. It's A game you'll find in A bargain bin A couple of years from now unused for twenty Dollars and few copies of that will sell.

The new Prestige Classes are generally more interesting and useful than those in the previous expansion pack (Shadows of Underntide). The new feats, like the Prestige Classes, are also much more interesting and useful than the previous expansion. The list of epic spells, improved henchman, max level, and tile sets are all improvements for the game.
Hordes of Underdark also adds a new set of official modules with the expansion. The plotline, dungeon layout, puzzles, and feel of the modules are far superior to that of previous official modules (and even better than most player/fan-base modules). A major problem is that it was designed for single-player only. Technically, you could play the game multiplayer, but the player hosting the game would have to be well versed in using the DM Client commands from the Player Client interface to combat these ""issues.""
Hordes of the Underdark has also released more glitches and bugs than even the original unpatched game. Even after Hordes being patched, most users experience occasional freezes and crashes. This is not such a big deal when you have the auto-save feature turned on, but still detracts from the excitement of playing the game.
One problem that I have witnessed in Neverwinter Nights from the beginning is that there has never been a large player/fan-base Mods for high levels (level 20). With the new cap of level 40 in Hordes, I have still not witnessed many high quality Mods for characters level 20-40. Lastly, those Mods that have been designed well for the higher levels frequently have a bias for more warrior based characters.
For players whose main focus in NWN is the single-player mode and enjoyed the expansion of freedoms in Shadows of Underntide (classes, feats, etc), those who enjoy ""maxing"" out a character or designing super templates, enjoy designing their own Mods or like to be able to keep up with playing the most current Mods, then Hordes of Underdark is an excellent expansion.

After installing the DX11 patch and the High Resolution texture pack, I have to say that this game has the best looking graphics I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, the ""wow"" factor of the graphics is not enough to sustain my interest in this run-of-the-mill on-rails shooter.  I'm quite shocked at how bland and boring the gameplay is.  It's nothing but going from checkpoint to checkpoint and killing everything in between.  That would be forgivable, but the AI in this game is really quite awful.  It's very, very easy to clear an area because the enemies rarely do anything other than stand in one spot behind cover and wait for you.  The fact that the suit options have been simplified (no strength and speed modes) means that my primary way of playing Crysis (running into a group and using strength to humiliate them) is no longer viable.  It's still possible to do some of that stuff, but you have to hold your melee and jump buttons for a couple of seconds before it will work, and I find it to be too slow to bother with. The game now feels like I'm playing the single player mode of Modern Warfare.  That's not a good thing in my eyes.  Crysis 2's multiplayer might be decent, but I really have no interest in it.

I would ultimately give this game a four star rating for someone that has never played Gauntlet (as well as for the price). However, if you have played the past Gauntlets (aside from the very original arcade one), you may be somewhat disappointed as I was. Everything about this game is awesome in comparison besides characters and the length of the game. The graphics are great compared to the old game of course! The downfall of this is that the game play is third person and you play it pretty far back from your character. This can sometimes cause confusion. However, they may have done this because when you play with 1-4 characters, you all are viewing the same screen (no splitscreen). The other downfall is the length of the game. My boyfriend and I beat this game within about 3 days. I wish that it was set up more like the old game was with different realms. This version seems to have the equivalence of 3-4 realms while the older game had 8 that I can at least remember if not a few more. There is an endless version that you play in waves that is kind of neat, but it can get old after playing it enough. My final concern was with the characters. In the Gauntlet that I had played, you could unlock many characters and change between the colors blue, red, yellow, and green. This version only allows five characters in the game. These characters are the valkyrie, warrior, wizard, archer, & necromancer. They always are the same color. The valkyrie is blue, the wizard is yellow, the archer is green, the warrior is red, and the necromancer is purple. There is some things that are neat that you are able to buy like different moves/relics, but the whole customization is very limited compared to the old one.

3.0,False,"02 12, 2005",A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00009X3V2,D. Mok,"For the first hour or so of playing this game, my hopes soared -- could it be that Electronic Arts finally came up with a game that was just enjoyable, without so much of the crap that they so often put in just to mar a perfectly good game?

Alas, deeper into the experience, the annoyance factor crept in.  Again.

At first, everything about this game's mechanics, graphics and design made sense.  Controls were smooth enough, the graphics (especially the cut movies) were superb and almost lifelike, and the presence of Pierce Brosnan lent credibility.  And there are no fewer than four Bond girls in this game, all famous faces -- supermodel Heidi Klum, Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie), Misaki Ito (Ju-On:  The Grudge) and, just to be weird, singer Mya.  I was definitely not a big fan of the last choice, either for the theme song or the character, but at least you get variety.  In the beginning of the game, I was mightily impressed with how the game kept you in the know about where you are and what you're doing -- there are step-by-step training sessions, the first of which was very cleverly designed as a classic Bond film opening, and the control scheme was simple and effective, instantly manageable.

Then, slowly, the game began to deteriorate.  More and more, the same strengths started becoming weaknesses.  You're thrown into missions where you're not told what to do, and most of them have a timer on them.  I was most annoyed with the ""Serena St. Germaine"" mission, where you have to drive to a location and supposedly ""avoid the patrols"".  But all paths that don't have patrols on them are guarded by impassable, unbeatable tanks...until I looked it up online and found that you had to drive right into the patrols, then lose them.  Didn't the game just tell me I was supposed to ""avoid"" these suckers?  In another mission, you're told to get ""beneath"" a train with your speeding car.  Turns out you have to get ""behind"" it closely until it sails over a bridge.  So it's the old ""play it over and over until you luck out on a solution"", which I never consider a good thing -- good for keeping the player stuck, but it annoys me to no end.

As in Syphon Filter:  The Omega Strain, you're forced to listen to an arrogant voice that berates you for every mistake you make, and in this one it's Judi Dench's ""you are a complete failure"" speeches, regaling you with insults every time you fail an objective.  In one level where you have to drive through a twisty town in the rain and avoid pedestrians, I just threw down the controller and called it quits -- Dench became too irritating, and every time you replay the mission, you have to do this first part over where you're just driving to a park to take a phone call.  It's called ""checkpoints"", you nimrods!

Such a pity, because for the first three or four missions, I was almost ready to give this game the first five-star rating I've ever given to a video game.  But it's typical of Electronic Arts, who in the past three or four years have made the Medal of Honor series so joylessly difficult that they ruined my memory of the franchise.

And to a certain extent, it provides quite an entertaining experience of doing so, even though the effect isn't quite as lasting as it could've been.

Before you begin, you'll be asked to choose a mode of play. Seasoned tycoon gamers, or those who simply want a more open-ended quest, can choose the ""Sandbox"" mode, which basically gives you the entire island of Manhattan, and the freedom to do almost everything with it. Almost, because some of the famous landmarks can only be built if you manage to achieve certain status. The Sandbox also allow you to turn off competition completely, but that's hardly what you want to play a game for, is it?

The ""Build New York"" mode is more structured, since it's actually the main campaign mode of the game. This offers tutorials on the various aspects of the game as you progress, as well as some missions along the way to keep the interest going. Missions come in the form of ""opportunities"", and fulfilling them will help improve your standing as a tycoon. An opportunity, for example, could be the influx of students into your district. To satisfy these students, you'll need to build street fashion retail shops, internet cafes, burger joints, and so on. Doing so will rake in the profits, which will in turn allow you to build more businesses. To fully complete an opportunity mission, however, you'd still need to achieve the objectives given by the game, which usually require you to hit a certain percentage of certain ratings. These are not difficult to achieve, but some level of multi-tasking is required to truly excel.

The rewards of completing a mission could be new items in your Build menu, or even Landmark Points, which you can use to build prominent landmarks. At the time of writing, I've built the Greenwich Church and the Greenwich Courthouse Library, which is not too bad for a few hours of play, I guess. Having landmarks in a district greatly increases its rating, and soon after you build them, you'll find yourself unlocking new districts where you can further strengthen your empire.

The strength of your empire is measured by your total earnings. It's therefore important to identify the needs of the people in the districts, and build businesses to satisfy them. Each business has a sphere of influence, which basically shows you how far its reaches in terms of fulfilling needs. You can also upgrade a business by improving its appeal and satisfaction level, but you'd need to accumulate upgrade credits to do so. Each business also has a fixed amount of upgrade limits, so you'd need to juggle between your resources, as well as each business' limitations. This could turn out to be quite a challenge. Also, if you fancy a competitor's business, you can always buy it over. It's usually expensive to do so, but the takeover could still proved to be fruitful if it's raking in profits by the truckload daily.

Tycoon City: New York is primarily focused on business, rather than infrastructural expansions. Sure, you create buildings all the time, but they only take a few seconds to be completed, letting you go straight into enhancing the businesses right away. Unfortunately, the game gives very little control over your finances. Apart from earning profits, and the odd sale of existing businesses, you won't get much opportunities to further your earnings. The game would have appeal better if it allows some level of business micromanagement. For example, after adding an advertising billboard to increase an appeal of a building, it'd be more fun if you can actually sell the advertising space for cash. Nonethelss, this is not a major issue.

The main issue for Tycoon City: New York is the limited gameplay. You'll find yourself clicking on empty plots of land, and creating new businesses. And that's basically it. Even with opportunities and expansions, what you'll effectively do over the course of the game is to click on empty plots of land, and create new businesses. This is exactly why the game gets old very quickly, even though it has the potential to be highly addictive.

Presentation wise, Tycoon City: New York is definitely a looker. The infrastructural models look solid, with great details on each type of building. A sense of appropriateness also comes into play for the upgrades, since you can add display items for your shops so that they look better. So, a restaurant may have an additional seating area outside the shop, a retail shop may have a bargain bin, and a night club may have a bouncer. All these add to the variety of graphics, and you can't help but stop and admire at these additional details from time to time.

The audio presentation is a little weak by comparison. The music is rather boring, and the voice-overs (yes, you do get to see people talking) are bland. But at least Deep Red included a nice little identification jingle for each type of building. This is seldom seen in games of this genre, and is quite a pleasant touch to accommodate the slow gameplay.

Overall, Tycoon City: New York is an enjoyable game. It's straight to the point, it's visually beautiful, and to a certain extent, it may even have mass appeal - who doesn't like making money? What drags it down is its overly mundane gameplay, and the lack of a real challenge. If you're simply looking to enjoy a tycoon game without ever risking the chance of losing the game, Tycoon City: New York should just do the trick.",Money doesn't grow on trees,1141862400,39,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

3.0,False,"09 29, 2014",ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0016GABR4,Micheal Hunt,"Having played Motorstorm, and Apocalypse, I came to the conclusion that these games are good, but I seem to lose interest in the end and never end up completing the game because it's just racing the same thing over and over again in a different style of vehicle, so you need to work out a new path to choose to win. Seeing this one with Monster Trucks made me give another Motorstorm installment a try, and it was pretty much as expected.

Yes, the graphics are great. Lots of beaches, jungles, dirt, mud, waterfalls and volcanoes, the scenery is great, as always with these MS games. The vehicles look decent, only as usual, I wish I could have more colors/paint-jobs and what not to choose from. There is never any complaints in the graphical department of these MS games, they do the best they can and don't get lazy and just fill in things with sprites and pixelated images.

The sound is fine, everything fits and has no off putting sounds. However the music I found clashed with the sounds, so I just muted that.

The controls are fine, they handle as expected, but what these games really need is a handbrake option. It may just be my own personal preference, but I think GTA5 has really pathed the way in how racing controls should become standard.

So no complaints so far, but there always is. The first thing is something that bugs me about every MS game. The way you compete in events. You are presented with 4 areas of racing, with only 2 events currently open in each. In order to open new events, they require to you win races, obviously. But that really sounds like such an old method these days that is just worn out and boring. Win to get to the next stage. I'd be OK with it if you entered an event and it was one race starting after the other, then when they are done, you open them for free mode or something, but this tiresome old way of doing it in these games is really no fun. Especially when there is only about 4 different tracks to each of the 4 events. making it about 16 tracks in total for the game. But having to race those same 16 tracks over and over and over again in designated vehicles becomes a drag on the fun factor and becomes boring fast.

The other thing is you only start off with certain vehicles, and then you unlock more as you rank up. The only way to rank up is to win races, or at least place in the top 3. But what is annoying is if you win bronze, you get the amount of points for bronze, but then if you repeat the race and earn silver or gold, you only get about 25 to 50 points which is how many more points it was than bronze. So you can only unlock a maximum amount of points in each race. And that is the ONLY way to rank up. What makes it worse, of you repeat the race, and place 1st, 2nd or 3rd, and you've already gotten gold, you are awarded no more rank points. Once you have obtained those points, there is no more to earn in that race. And racing is the ONLY way to earn any RP points to rank up. That to me is pure BS. The developers are saying, win gold in every race you are presented with to open the next few. So you are forced to play every event, and some events you may not like. For me personally, I hate speed races, which is a solo gate crash race to hit every check point. Those should be bonus games to me, I never find them fun in any game personally.

Then there is the lack of race types. For the most part it's racing in a field of 16 competitors. But the only other events are, as mentioned, Speed, and Elimination, where you better not be in last place when the timer counts down or you will be eliminated, until the final car is left. A fun race, but that's it! Just those 3 races! So I can't imagine this game was much of a fan favorite in the multiplayer modes... which btw is annoying as it's vertical split screen, with no option for horizontal like some of us prefer.

One other thing that annoyed me was the camera views. there is only 2 views to choose. One from a driver POV in the cabin, and one behind the vehicle. Which is pretty standard, sure, but it badly needs an option to allow you to lower or raise the camera view to where you like it, because when racing as a large truck, you can't see anything in-front of you from the rear cameras angle, and you just crash into things and come of the track unless you memorize every last inch of the track. Which is another annoying thing, you have to do just that before you can win races because things just come out of nowhere and stack/crash you.

Overall, it's a decent game, but far from reaching it's full potential. If you have played the other MS games, this one is no different in physics and control. If racing in new environments interests you, then it's going to be a great game. But if you're like me, and just can't be bothered repeating the same things over and over again to achieve nothing in the end, then yeah, it's just an OK game that I probably won't ever play again in future.",Motostorm... the one with Monster Trucks,1411948800,,,

3.0,False,"04 17, 2008",A20UHWR387EFAG,B000UQURQ6,Smeddley,"Pros:

* Staged gameplay: you progress in chunks, and you know you've accomplished what you need to when it allows you to move on.
* In-game hints: not the most helpful in-game hints, but between the journal instructions and the 'finger of suspicion' you can find your way through.  Also, the dialogue gives a lot of hints and occasionally tells you what to do.
* Logical use of items for the most part - no combining dust bunnies with smarties to create a new sentient life form.
* Smooth gameplay and easy-to-use menus.
* Overall it was a well-programmed game with only a few minor continuity glitches (there's one point where you can still 'see' something that has already been retrieved and removed).

Cons:

* Auto-play sequences can be touchy to initiate - there's one time where you simply have to go back and look at something to get it to play, even if you've looked at that same thing dozens of times and it hasn't changed.
* Double-click to view inventory is a real pain - I had to click dozens of times to bring up the view screen.  Why didn't they add a 'view' button to the main inventory page, or make it a right-click function?!
* Real veterans of this type of game might find it a bit on the easy side - there were very few brain-teaser-like puzzles and not a lot of action.  The majority of the time you spend walking about, which reminds me:
* Too much time spend getting from place to place.  I realize this is because you do bump into people on the way, but it was a lot of clicking, especially if you're not super-efficient in your moves.  I prefer games with fixed locations that can be jumped between with the use of a map screen, but that's a personal preference.

Overall:

I quite enjoyed it, and even as impatient as I am I didn't have to cheat... much.  There were a LOT of characters to keep track of, though, and that got a bit confusing.  I would have really liked a cheat sheet with their names and faces just so I could keep them straight (but I have a problem with names, so maybe that's just me).  I think the mystery was straightforward and Poirot really walks you through it, so it wasn't as much of a mind-bending challenge as games with tons of puzzles, but it was relaxing in a way, too.  I think it's a great starter game for those not used to this type of game (but why would I combine a spaghetti strainer with a porkchop?! - the days of the old 'Day of the Tentacle' and 'Sam and Max') or even a veteran who wants to kick back and take it easy.

But man is it fun. One of the reasons why its considered so short is because the gameplay is so fast. You can zip from one cover to another in a blink while popping out to shoot, nice and easy. The real star of the show however, is the bullet curve. Being able to shoot a bullet around an object to hit the guy hiding there is as fun as it sounds. There are also a few segments where you have to shoot bullets in mid air as well as activate bullet time to slow things down and shoot faster than the bad guys can react.

In the end though, the game is very much lacking in terms of general content. It feels like a budget game and should be priced as such. Luckily, it is. For $15 bucks (currently), this game is worth picking up.

3.0,True,"05 5, 2014",A1TR1KNR3VKPHY,B0073ESZ58,OkinawanMatt,"Having this grip slightly improves my gaming experience with the PS Vita, as my large hands get cramped within 10 minutes of playing any game.  While I was initially worried with the design since the Vita was only being held in place by a millimeter's worth of plastic at the top and bottom, my mind was at ease after a month's worth of use without the Vita falling out, even when I swung it by the handle while walking around.  However, there is one glaring issue for adult hands: The handle is too narrow, with very little to fill your palm while gripping it.  Let me paint you a picture: When you hold an Xbox 360 controller, your fingers naturally curl around each side of the controller, allowing you to rest your fifth and fourth finger on the back of the controller, with the rest of the handles filling your palm.  Now imagine if you took 1/2 of the volume of the plastic out of each handle to make this PS Vita grip and the open grips are too far down and you cannot reach the bumper buttons.  So you have to move your hand up, and now your fingers are pushing against the back touch pad of the Vita.  There's no winning in this situation:  You either have to grip the back of the vita or grip the bottom of the handles and not be able to reach the bumpers.  The only reason this grip adds comfort is that it provides just a bit more plastic to fill in your palms and give you something to hold on to.  On games that don't require the bumper, it feels just a bit better.  To its benefit, I was able to finish a remote play (via PS4) of the entire single player campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts by playing 1-hour spurts before my hand started cramping.  When playing Pixel Junk Monsters HD, I am able to play for two hours or more since I can use the actual grips (no need to reach for the bumpers).  If you're an adult deciding on a purchase for yourself, find an extension/grip that offers a little more padding and girth.  In the end, this does provide more comfort than using the Vita on its own, so I will give it a 3/5 rating.","Works, but not designed for adults",1399248000,3,,

I was feeling nostalgic of how many fun hours I had spent playing that game back in the day and hoping to re-live some of those feelings again! To my disappointment, the game felt foreign to me and handled very differently than what I am now accustomed to. Don't get me wrong, the visuals were definitely up-to-date. I guess the main problem was, being spoiled with Halo 3. You expected the game to handle, feel, and flow in that manner, which Anniversary does not deliver. The co-op was a very nice edition as well as the extra goodies, but even then... that seemed to fall short. Getting ""stuck"" on walls was annoying to say the least when fighting. Your shields seemed non-existing while the covenant were sporting over shields. I felt like it was not challenging as much as it was annoying! I was playing co-op with my brother, he being the bigger Halo fan, but were bored after a few hours of playing. My last complaint was the price. At forty dollars, I could not see the justification for shelling out that much cash. The only thing I felt was worth while was the DLC for Halo reach. If in doubt, rent it first and try it out for a few hours. If it holds your interest, then purchase it (since it has gone down in price) and you will see for yourself if it really re-kindles your memories of first playing this game.",Halo - some things are better left to memory,1324080000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Now if you have existing preferences for either system (e.g., you like certain console exclusives, all your friends play on a certain system, etc.), then by all means, let that be the deciding factor. I am writing this to influence those of you on the fence between the two systems.

I consider myself a gamer and, given the same game appearing on both systems, I'd rather go with the system that offers the better graphics and more power. ""Communicating"" with my television through a Kinect is not something I looked forward to doing.

Now if you want the option of communicating with your game system, then the Xbox One is probably for you. Though my Kinect has never been attached, I am willing to say that for some, the novelty of talking to/waving at your television will be something that you are looking for. I'm not really writing this for you.

For you gamers who actually want the best graphics when you are playing (and if you don't want the best graphics, buy an Xbox 360 or a PS3 and save some money), it has already been shown that the Playstation 4 is more powerful graphically than the Xbox One.

From Forbes.com:  ""Xbox Ones performance has been coming under scrutiny since launch, most recently with the news that Tomb Raider: Definitive edition runs at a higher framerate on PS4.""

There are articles such as this all over the 'Net pointing out the graphic differences between the two systems in games such as Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4 and others. If the best graphics are important to you, you might want to seek out these articles before laying your money down.

I'm not saying there is anything ""wrong"" with either system. But, as in my tablet choice, the graphics on a retina display iPad trump those on my Surface 2 but I prefer the Surface 2 because I hate iTunes software on my Windows computers and want a USB port and an SD card slot.

I believe this game continues the great legacy of the Halo series and is very promising towards the future.

The Limited Edition on the other hand... There really isn't much I like about how this Limited Edition thing turned out. The physical things given are all little gimmick type things.

-The poster is folded, so although it is a neat layout of the armor, it shows horribly with its fold lines.

-The clipboard, while cool and has some little info things about weapons, it is just a rundown of the basics. I get it looks neat, but is still small, and you can't even use the clipboard for anything else so it is Kinda a waste for me.

-The inserts, the mission rundowns and score sheet are just papers for me. Yeah I get they look cool that they are official, but overall really a miss for me.

-Forward Onto Dawn, This is a REALLY cool miniseries, but it is just a code to get it on the Xbox itself, I was thinking it would be in disc format, but no. There really isn't a reason to use the code, as the Xbox supports YouTube, and can just watch it off that. But whatever, it is still a solid mini-series.

Taking nothing away from the game itself, the mechanics, the graphics, the diversity or the community, this is as much Final Fantasy as it is Everquest. Somewhere in the transition from Tidus, Yuna and Auron to the millions of participants in the story of FFXI, Square-Enix's trademarked personality was lost.
Seeing this massive world hustling around you, encountering all these varied player-controlled and CPU-controlled characters and just trying to find your way from one end of a small city to the other is INCREDIBLY overwhelming. There's so much initial information to absorb, so much going on at any one time that even the most capable of minds will spin within moments of their first connection to the FFXI servers. Now that's a flaw I've noticed with several MMORPGs in the past, so I'd be lying if I said I was surprised to see it in full effect here, but I was hoping the bigwigs and creative geniuses behind the legendary FF series could devise a solution. Instead, you meet half a dozen non-playable characters with a penchant for lengthy monologues and strikingly similar names, gain a brief quest or two and are immediately thrust into the fray. I was stuck in a corner, confused, infuriated and utterly lost within five minutes, and I've been playing digital role playing games for most of my life.
Another thing this title shares with its online-genre competition is the notable de-emphasis on any real, compelling, interwoven storyline. There's always this sense hanging over your head that something big might just be about to happen, but it never does. You'll catch little bits and pieces of information from NPCs in various parts of the globe, but it's mostly inconsequential and not all that interesting. There's a very loosely-illustrated theme of competition between the planet's three dominant countries that surfaces from time to time, yet there's no drama. These three nations seem to be on the brink of war with one another, but they're all afraid of the risk involved with making that first move. It's like they built an entire game around the non-playable characters who didn't matter in previous Final Fantasies.
Gameplay is actually very quick and easy to learn, but seems to rely much more heavily on luck than previous titles. If you're in combat with an enemy, it's not uncommon to miss one another for upwards of three or four turns in a row. Random encounters have been done away with entirely, and you can see (and, if the situation calls for it, avoid) every hostile creature in the field. The endless mashing of the ""Attack"" option has been removed from play, as once you've drawn your weapon and begun a fight, your character will continue chopping away until you tell him to do something else or either he or the monster is dead. Both dealing out and receiving damage builds up your ""TP"" meter, which has taken the place of the traditional ""Limit Breaks,"" and can be used to fire off a special attack once it's filled sufficiently. Using magic is a much more strategic factor in this title, since it's possible to have your chant interrupted by a well-timed attack. Thus, you won't want to hold off on casting that life-saving Cure spell until a second or two before the enemy strikes. That hypothetical sword is double-edged, though, and if you're lucky you can halt an enemy's spell in precisely the same fashion.
Online play through Square-Enix's servers is an absolute triumph. The sheer number of players in the world at any one time is amazing, and I can only recall one or two instances where I experienced any lag whatsoever. Additionally, they're always throwing in little bonuses, events and surprises to keep the world fresh, exciting and unpredictable. I signed on one evening to find three moogles floating in the middle of town square, surrounded by literally hundreds of players. When I spoke to the moogles, they gave me an egg with a letter printed on the shell. I was dumbfounded until I realized it was the week before Easter. They were simultaneously distributing and hiding little easter eggs throughout the city, and if you gave them the lettered eggs that matched up with the first three letters of your character's name, they gave you a prize. It's a really nice side effect of putting the whole game online; you can customize the experience for any reason imaginable.
As a whole, though, I was disappointed. The magic of the entire line of Final Fantasy games is missing from this title, and even attempting to associate it with its brethren was a mistake. Don't let that fact mislead you, however. As a standalone title with no ties whatsoever to the FF universe, this still wouldn't have knocked my socks off. It's full of unrealized potential, moments that stopped just short of being spectacular and long, dull periods of nothingness. The vast majority of your game time is spent running along an empty path, healing in a corner or participating in a boring, pointless conversation with one of the million useless non playable characters. Its successes are few; the successful transition from full-blown fantasy to a more reality-based setting, the tremendous capabilities of the Square-Enix servers and the gorgeous visuals, and its failures are many; the lack of story, the stale taste of almost everything in the world and the unnecessarily difficult battle system.

3.0,True,"08 18, 2008",AIOPD46ZIV8K2,B0015HYPOO,Rick V,"Having used the Microsoft Wireless Wheel on my kids' XBOX 360 I decided to get one for my PS3, thinking that it would be great to dust off the amazing-looking Motorsport. Much to my dismay I found (and I truly hope someone will call me an idiot and show me how to make this work) that Force Feedback is not supported in that game. The steering wheel is extremely awkward to use in Motorsport without the FB motors spinning as it is almost the same feel as with using the sixaxis feature.
The wheel does work well with GT5 however I do not like that game that much. I ding the wheel therefore with one star as it lacks game support.

About the wheel itself: it looks and feels nice in the hands and the 900 degree rotation is a cool feature. What I do not like is the clamp: these are screw-type clamps to connect the wheel to the table. It lacks an easy on-off mechanism like MS built into their XBOX wheel. Little disappointing as this wheel is 20 bucks more expensive than the XBOX MS wheel.
Also, the screw-clamps lack 'room' to clamp on more modern / thicker tables (Ikea coffee tables) so if you have a table edge beyond 1.5"" you will have to find something else to clamp onto. This also made me deduct a star as not eveyone will have a table that fits this mechanism and they should have created a quick connect feature / system like the MS wheel.","Great wheel with minor flaws, BUT: support lacks from games...",1219017600,,,
3.0,False,"01 28, 2016",AZKB5T3T2LTE8,B0050SVHZO,Outrun1986,"This is a decent video game console, but its lacking all of the other games from the big publishers. While it is in the generation of the PS4 and the Xbox One it simply does not have the power of those consoles, therefore it gets left out when it comes to most big 3rd party games.

However this console does have family games, which seems to be what the XBox One and PS4 are severely lacking in. Almost every game except for things like Skylanders, Disney Infinity and the Lego games on there is a rated M shooter game. I am an adult but I am not into those types of games so those consoles clearly wouldn't fit my needs. It seems that most family and kid games are moving from the home console to smartphones and tablets except for a handful of titles.

I personally wouldn't buy this unless you are a die hard Nintendo fan, or want to experience Nintendo games like Super Mario Kart and Super Smash Brothers. I also don't think that Nintendo products are worth full price, so you should definitely buy this console on sale or whatever way you can find to get it cheaper than retail price. If you are stuck paying full price for it, its probably not worth it.

The games on this console are more expensive than on other consoles, in addition, Nintendo seems to intentionally limit the supply of certain titles so if you don't buy them as soon as they come out then you won't have a chance of buying them at all unless you want to pay scalper prices on the secondary market. They seem to have one shipment of games and when that shipment is gone, then that is it. Its not always possible to know if you want a game before it comes out so this is a very hard situation to deal with.

The Virtual console games and other digital games are also more expensive than on other platforms. TBH, Steam seems to be the most ultimate platform for video games these days with the most variety of games at the lowest prices. If you are really into games and want the best selection without having to be tied to a specific console from a specific manufacturer then I suggest you skip all 3 major consoles and get a gaming PC. I notice that a lot of my friends are just getting a good PC these days and forgoing all 3 consoles, and using that to play games. I have found games on steam for a small fraction of the price that they are on the Wii U, such as finding a game for $1 on steam when the same game on the Wii U is $10-15.

With 8GB of space, only about 3GB of space is actually available to the user for storage. Most games on this console take up way more than that, and having 3GB of space total to download a game is an absolute shame in this day and age. To be honest though the 32GB console isn't that much better because you will probably eventually fill that up as well. My suggestion is to buy a USB flash drive and use that for storage. I know Nintendo recommends against this but trust me, I have been using a USB drive with this console for more than 2 years and nothing has happened yet, so this is the route I definitely recommend trying. External hard drives are difficult to use with this console as well, as most do not come with a power supply, and this console requires a hard drive with a power supply if you are going to use an external one. External hard drives can fail as well, so I would definitely go with the USB drive in this case. Even if you buy the 32GB console, you will probably have to buy a USB drive anyways.

The console is white, which I like, since it shows less dust, and was a major decision in me choosing this model of console to buy. The white console looks so much better than the black.

The Gamepad controller is required for most games, this means if your Gamepad breaks then you are out of luck. Gamepad replacements from Nintendo seem to cost just as much as buying another console, so you better baby that Gamepad and take perfect care of it, or else you will be shelling out for a new one. What I mean here is many games and the system itself requires the gamepad console to be connected to the system in order for it to even start up. In the Lego games for example, you must press a button on the gamepad to start them or else they won't start. I seem to be hearing about a lot of people who have the Wifi module in their gamepad burn out, this is the thing that connects the gamepad to the console. However I also hear this can be fixed with a youtube tutorial and a part that only costs a few dollars, so if this happens to you, be ready to open up your gamepad and fix it yourself. Or you will have to call Nintendo and shell out $$$$ for it to be repaired.

The Gamepad also has an intentionally short battery life of about 2-3 hours. I suggest using another controller like the Pro controller or the Wii remote and Nunchuck when you are able to, to save wear and tear on your gamepad. But Nintendo will sell you a bigger battery for just $30-50 on its online store! I believe this is the battery that was originally supposed to be included in the console in the first place but Nintendo obviously decided to cut corners and put in a cheaper battery. This becomes painfully obvious when you open up the gamepad's battery compartment to find a slot exactly the size of the extended battery right in there, with the original battery taking up only about half the space of the compartment.

The Gamepad also must charge via a separate wall adapter ,which means you will need 2 outlets to operate this console, possibly a 3rd outlet if you are using a powered, external hard drive for this console. The Wii remote sensor bar still needs to be used as well so you have to have that set up too. I would prefer if the gamepad could just charge right off the console to eliminate an extra outlet. In a house with too much stuff and not enough outlets, I don't really appreciate that design choice, and it just seems like a stupid design choice.

Now you may be wondering why I bought this console, the main reason I bought this console is because of backwards compatibility (and I somehow managed to get it at a good price). This console allows you to take your Nintendo Wii system and transfer all its data right over to the Wii U. This leaves you to sell your Wii console for whatever you can get for it and apply what you sold it for to the cost of a new Wii U. This alone makes the system a bargain and reduces the price of it without losing any Wii functions. This system is both a Nintendo Wii and a Wii U in one console! Its super awesome to have 2 consoles in one, and I wish more manufacturers would take note of this. As this is the reason I am NOT buying a PS4 or Xbox one, while the Xbox One does offer some backwards compatibility its far from complete and forget the PS4, you can't even play PS3 games or PS Classics on it, both of which I own a lot of. This saves space on my entertainment center, and lets me have 2 consoles in one, I can still play all the Wii games I love, plus I can get any new Wii U games that may want to buy. My entertainment center doesn't have room for any more consoles, and all the HD outputs on my TV and HDMI switch are full, therefore if I get another console, one will have to go. Since I have digital games tied to all of my consoles, I am very hesitant to let them go as then I will lose my games since they do not transfer over to the new consoles. One would assume that manufacturers would adapt the library of digital games on one console to the next but apparently that does not happen. My Wii was also getting a bit old, and since these things don't last forever, it was a no-brainer to upgrade to the Wii U.",A decent console but its not worth full price,1453939200,,,

Durham,"The Alone in the Dark series goes back a long way (even pre-dating the Resident Evil franchise) in terms of pioneering the survival horror genre, with this new installment kind of being a re-boot for the series.  Once again filling the shoes of paranormal investigator Edward Carnby, Alone in the Dark finds Carnby caught in the middle of an apocalyptic event while investigating strange happenings in Central Park.  The first thing you'll notice is that Alone in the Dark boasts some wonderfully creepy and spooky environments that drip with eerie atmosphere.  In fact, the areas are so well designed (even for the Wii version) that you'll often find yourself admiring your surroundings while dodging demons and beasts.  The game looks good in general as well, despite a few graphical glitches that occur, while the game's solid score adds to the overall survival horror atmosphere.  What's really sad about Alone in the Dark is that the game's potential to be something special is marred by technical issues.  Namely, just moving around can be a chore.  The control issues (particularly on the Wii) that present themselves during combat and puzzle solving only add layers of frustration to the game, which is a crying shame, and the game's schizophrenic camera doesn't help make matters any better either.  Despite it's flaws, Alone in the Dark does present some innovation in terms of it's item inventory use and some dramatic moments that will jolt you out of your chair.  The game's story is intriguing, and there are some great lighting effects too.  All in all, Alone in the Dark is a worthwhile trip that could have been something truly great, but in the end is brought down thanks to it's technical issues.

However, if you decide to go ahead and buy it, it can be made rather enjoyable with a XBox 360 controller and some mods. Still, the best advice is to wait and see what the developer and modders do next before buyiing.

Gameplay: Right off the bat, the gameplay is very awkward with the default keyboard and mouse controls. The real shame is that these controls cannot be remapped, which is rather inexplicable. The game was made to be played with a 360 controller which greatly enhances gameplay. If you are one of these PC gamers who thinks gamepads are beneath you, then pass on this game. However, with a controller plugged in, you're in for a treat. The ships handle pretty well and the camera (controlled by the right stick on the 360 gamepad) lets you rotate in every direction.  Much of the combat--the whole game is based in space--is cinematic, as if it were directly from the movies. Your adrenaline will get pumped in a number of fights as you play with and against the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, and the Borg.  Moreover, Legacy is easily the best looking Star Trek game to date and certainly the most immersive.

The game comes with a fairly interesting single-player campaign of 15 missions. However, it has a problem, a big problem. There is no in-mission save system. The game autosaves between missions, but you're on your own during the mission. This is a huge problem because some of the missions are quite long (over an hour) and any slip up means you're have to start from the beginning. It's an inexcusable oversight on the part of the developers that just doesn't make any sense. Before starting the campaign, I would strongly suggest downloading the Community Mod (0.4 is the most recent version) that adds an unlimited save feature, easier access to the map-making tools, some additional maps, and some nice textures. I couldn't imagine trying to play this game without this fan-made mod loaded, given how frustrating some of the missions can be.  The mod also opens up all of the missions so that you can play them in any order anytime.

The skirmish mode is lots of fun, but it, too, suffers from a huge design flaw.  You can have up to four sides with four ships, but you can't select the AI enemy ships and have set-piece battles.  Thus, no recreating the Khan vs. Kirk battles of Star Trek II or the battle royale against the Borg cube at the beginning of Star Trek: First Contact (although there is a mod available).  This omitted feature alone greatly damages the replay value of the game. Also, the lack of other gameplay modes besides death match is disappointing. I hope that the developers will patch these options into the game, or some enterprising modder will at least unlock the AI enemy selection option. Again, I have no idea why this feature was left out.

Graphics: Generally, the visuals are stunning. The ships are all finely detailed, and other objects (planets, stars, nebulae, etc.) look really good. Many fights look like film footage from movies and are worth taking screenshots of.  The only sore spot in the graphics is the explosions, which can be downright ugly.  Borg ships are the worse and sometimes show blank square panels as they break apart.  It's really a shame since the other parts of the game are so attractive.

Sound: Everything, thankfully, is in order with the audio.  The orchestral soundtrack is suitably ""Star Trek"" in feel, and the voice acting by the 5 captains is good.  Sound effects are done well, too.

Technical issues: The game does not have any major technical issues beyond the missing features, but there are glitches. The game manual is inaccurate in places and is obviously a carryover from the XBox 360 version of the game.  The default control scheme cannot be remapped, and you cannot replay a skirmish game without dropping to the main menu. The game crashed about a dozen times during the campaign, usually during heavy engagements. On an up-to-date computer, this game should play smoothly and look very good.

Replayability/Value: While the campaign is good overall (though frustrating in places), the replay value of the game will not be decent until the option for selecting AI enemy ships in skirmish mode is added.  Although I don't play online, I suppose the multiplayer experience can be good if you can find a game. Ultimately, Legacy is the shell or promise of a good game, not the reality of one. It's for a niche audience of Star Trek gamers who have the time and patience to wait for the official patches and the fan-made goodies (including texture mods, new maps, new missions, etc.) that will make this game really shine. The poor folks who bought this game within the first week of release (or even worse, pre-ordered) and the people who are not interested in mods will suffer the most from this purchase. Of course, it's not right, and the publisher (Bethesda) and developer (Mad Doc) should be ashame. However, I predict that in two years from now this game will be like Bridge Commander and Starfleet Command 3; that is, an out-of-print, heavily modded cult classic with used copies selling on eBay for $100 each. If you can just wait for the great mods to come out and more patches, this game will likely be worth the asking price. If you are looking for a great Star Trek game out of the box, look elsewhere.

Overall, I rate this game 3 stars. If you play it with an XBox 360 controller, add 1/2 star. And if you add some choice fan-made mods to the game (start with the Community Mod), add a little more to this score.

Pros:
--Graphics (especially ships)
--Sounds and voice acting
--Cinematic battles
--Decent campaign (with Community Mod save-game feature)
--Convincing Star Trek atmosphere
--Fun battles (with XBox 360 controller)

Cons:
--Goofy default controls
--No in-mission save feature
--No ability to select AI enemy ships in skirmish mode
--Ugly explosions
--Limited gameplay modes
--Poor manual
--An overall lack of polish

The game has a El Da de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead) theme that helps lend a spooky atmosphere to the game.

Even the goofy, amateurish voice acting adds to the unique feel of the game.

The concept, the gameplay, and the graphics are cool, but where this game falls down is that the darkness mode challenges are too time sensitive.  Timing is so critical it makes the game practically unplayable after the first level.  I wanted to love this game, but when I can't even finish the second level on easy mode...it's a letdown.

-- Easy drop-in charging; no need to worry about whether or not you have aligned the plug and the socket correctly
-- Completely unobtrusive dongle which you'll never notice while using the controller
-- Multiple charge blocks can be attached for a custom charging station

Here's what I do not like about this charger:
-- The lights are way too bright. Does it even need lights?
-- Nyko customer service is non-existent

I received a couple of these (the Charge Block Duo pack) as a gift, and was really excited about the prospect of being able to easily charge my controllers without having to run a USB cable from my console, which is mounted on the wall across the room. Unfortunately, one of the included dongles was bad, which I determined by process of elimination. I e-mailed Nyko to ask for a replacement dongle, which I thought would be easy and fast; it's a tiny piece of plastic which doesn't do anyone any good without the rest of the components. After a few weeks: Nyko did not respond, so I just bought a replacement from Amazon.

Once I finally got two working where I wanted them, I noticed that my bedroom was no longer dark at night; these things are super bright! I don't know why Nyko felt the need to try and ""improve"" upon the Dual Shock 4 charging indicator; before these my controllers would gently pulse with amber light until they were done charging, and then went dark when fully charged. Nyko's Charge Block takes a nearly opposite approach: rapid, bright-white flashing LED bars, followed by continuous, full-on brightness when fully charged. My initial solution was to apply electrical tape to the light bars, but adhesion to the Charge Block is not great, so light still shines out at various places. The best solution was black acrylic paint; a fully-charged controller atop the block let me see all the places where light crept out of the box, and I just kept applying paint until all the light was gone.

(I wanted to try and pry the thing apart to see if I could address the problem from the inside, but was worried about totally ruining the block because I couldn't find any screws or a good place to start prying.)

If Nyko could put an on/off switch for the light on the next generation of these: they would basically be the perfect controller charger. This would also have been at least a 4-star review if they had responded to my e-mail and just sent me a single, tiny, replacement dongle which probably costs pennies to manufacture.

So, if you get these and all the parts work: it does the job pretty well!
If you don't care about super bright LED bars in the location where you'll be charging your controllers: this is probably the best charging solution you can find for the Dual Shock 4 at this moment.",Why does it need such bright lights?,1484956800,5,,
3.0,False,"07 26, 2010",A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B000LT26UC,ChibiNeko,"I loved playing Cake Mania on the computer so I figured that buying it for the DS would be a pretty safe bet. Oh boy, I had no idea what I was getting myself into...

The game idea is the same as the internet version. Our plucky heroine has returned from college & discovered that the family bakery has been closed by a huge corporation. (Sales were terrible.) As a result Jill has sworn to do whatever it takes to regain the family store- even if it means selling cakes from her home!

I was kind of torn by this game. On one hand the game play is very similar to the computer version. Just like on the computer, you have to put cakes together in specific ways & get it to the customers before they storm out. The happier they are when they get the cake, the higher the tip you get. This is a good thing as it's the original game that drew me in. I didn't want to get my DS version & have it be completely different.

Where the bad comes in is in the screen size. The game version is just too tiny. What took up a good size portion of a computer screen has been compacted into a teeny little screen. The visibility is bad enough for the regular cakes but when it comes to the more complex cakes with two tiers & a topping, the visibility is EXTREMELY poor. As in ""I had to quit after a while because my eyes began to hurt"" poor- the images were just that small. This might not bother some players, but for those of us who don't have the best eyesight it will just be a huge irritation that will put a damper on the game play. There's also some glitches in the game, but nothing that has completely put me off of playing & re-playing.

My recommendation is to get this used or to just stick to the PC versions. The game still captures the fun of the original PC version, but the small screen is such a turn off that I don't think I'll be getting any of the other versions that are out for the DS.

It feels like it would be impossible for the game to live up to anyone's expectations because all expectations seem to far exceed its grasp. It's a game that, before release, has been hailed as one of the game's that will completely take us into the next generation. No Man's Sky doesn't really do that. The game we got is largely one that has potential.

Let's begin with all that is so good with No Man's Sky. All of the production elements of the game are really good. No Man's Sky is a gorgeous game with an aesthetic that could potentially immerse you all on its own. Everything about the game looks and feels otherworldly and that really helps the exploration part of the game. By seeming so otherworldly but still feeling life like in some way, No Man's Sky stands to actually be an immersive experience. The creatures and plants you encounter stand out. The various planets that you'll go to have a look and feel that just works. There are few games that really nail the science fiction look quite as well as No Man's Sky. But No Man's Sky does it without having to be super photorealistic to do so, nor does it really have to be super cartoony. The environments are vibrant and colorful. The creatures that you encounter and the NPCs (when you do encounter them) look really good too. No doubt, No Man's Sky is an impressive game visually. There are times when it feels less like you're playing a game and that you may be exploring though a living painting. It increases the sense of exploration from the game and makes you feel a sense of wonder as you look at it. The game is by far one of the most visually impressive I've ever seen.

Just as its visual presentation is astonishing, so too is the music and sound design. The soundtrack gives a sense that we'll be exploring far off distant lands while also gripping you with a sense of wonder and awe. But it can also portray that you're venturing into the unknown. Just as there's a great sense of wonder and awe, the soundtrack can also contain a sense of mystery and isolation when it wants to. Like its visuals, the soundtrack does a great job of immersing you into what No Man's Sky is: exploration.

This is where the game can hit a snag. The main goal is to explore much as of the galaxy as you can on your way to the center of the universe . Along the way you'll be given a scanner so that you can chart new planets and species that you'll get to name, and acquire units of money for discovering. Your scanner can also be used to scan for resources within a certain distance. Settle in, because you'll be using your scanner constantly. You'll also be able to gather materials and upgrade your spaceship to continue further. Throughout you'll also run into a few NPCs that you'll have to talk to for other resources if need be (usually by answering questions for them and selecting the right dialog options) to continue your journey.

The game begins by teaching you these things relatively easily. You awake on a planet where you'll have to find resources to prepare your ship. In doing so you'll learn how to craft the items you need and how to go mining for other materials. You'll also be able to explore outpost. All the while there's always something degrading in No Man's Sky such as your life support or your environmental shielding. You can use your jetpack to reach high places for a limited time, or sprint for a short period of time. Everything you do in the game is likely to deplete something whether it be stamina or the resources you carry around. Most things in No Man's Sky are about resource management. You'll constantly be having to mine resources or pick plants to get what you need. You'll also have to jump in your ship where you can engage thrusters and go to another nearby planet where you'll land and start mining resources again. Throughout the journey, your inventory is bound to get full constantly. You can expand it by finding certain drop pods on the planets. As you explore you'll  also come across outposts. Some you can use a bypass chip to find other outposts in the area easily.

The planets are, indeed as huge as they look. And once you repair your ship you're going to get into the habit of using it to get across the planet if you want to explore everything on it. If you want to find all the outpost, scan and analyze all the animals and plants you're going to have to be mining for resources to keep your ship going constantly. Most important of all is making sure you've got fuel and making sure you can engage the pulse jump. Luckily, even in space you can mine for the resources you need relatively easily. You'll also use a lot of your resources to craft other items for you to utilize and this may very well be one of the most important things in the game. If you don't learn to craft early and often in No Man's Sky you're going to be stuck.

Unfortunately, there isn't really that much to No Man's Sky aside from this. Go to a planet, name it and then scan the species and plants you find there. If possible, find an Atlas interface so that you can make that exploration to the center of the galaxy worth it. Then mostly gather resources to go to the next planet and do the same thing. The game isn't really combat heavy, even in moments where you fly through space. It's a game more about exploration than anything, but after two or three hours of No Man's Sky you've pretty much explored the depth of its gameplay. The game lets you explore a whole a lot but it can feel like you're sailing across the ocean in a lifeboat with no land in sight. This is to say that eventually exploration gets boring and dull. While the feeling of loneliness and isolation can be appreciated in a game all about exploring the vastness of space, there isn't a whole lot that you can do beyond the basic setup you're presented with. You may think there's something more to No Man's Sky but there really isn't. Most of your time will be spent traveling from one planet to the next exploring it and naming new species of animals you find and finding ways to keep your ship going so you can get to the next destination. The game doesn't present a lot of variety through this experience either.

The problem with No Man's Sky is that it presents an experience that can only really sustain itself for a handful of hours... but it's been stretched to fit dozens of hours. You can take your time to explore and hopefully get something more out of naming planets and species of animals, but it can't separate from the fact that No Man's Sky has little to offer beyond that. Had it been a shorter experience it might feel less empty and monotonous. As it stands, there just isn't much to No Man's Sky. Most of the species you encounter aren't really out to harm you, and the ones that do pose very little threat. Most of them don't do anything. There are environmental hazards but most of them are easy to avoid as well. .

If the worst should happen and you die you'll lose everything you were carrying.  Fear not, however, you'll be able to find your grave and get all your resources back pretty easily. If you die on the way then those resources are gone forever. But Dark Souls this is not. Dying in No Man's Sky is a very rare occurrence. If any of your meters are getting low the game will constantly remind you until you do something about it, and the resources to restore your life support or environmental shielding are everywhere. Even fighting lifeforms in No Man's Sky is a piece of cake. You'll never be in any real danger while playing. The game puts an emphasis on exploring by also making sure very little will get in the way of it. Death is never a big problem, it's only a minor setback.

Then there are the little things. In particular, No Man's Sky simply doesn't have the greatest interface. The menus are especially problematic. All the menus work as though this a PC game. You have to use the analog stick to hover a cursor over items to select them instead of just being able to sift through them. This even happens for menu choices where you should just be able to hit up and down on the d-pad and press X to select. But even selecting options sometimes requires you to hold the button for a moment while a meter fills up for the choice to be made. This is... interesting, but I don't fully understand this particular design choice. On a PC this wouldn't be something to complain about, but on a console it's a problem. It's a sluggish cursor. This also happens when you're in combat. The game doesn't pause when you're in the inventory screen. If you have to recharge your weapon or go into the menu it doesn't stop, and you'll have to deal with that sluggish cursor. Going through menus isn't fast and efficient. This is problematic for a game where you'll spend a lot of time in the menu. Likewise, you're going to be filling up your inventory incredibly fast. You're going to have to constantly go into your menu and rearrange your inventory and the interface just isn't set up to make this efficient at all.

In truth, No Man's Sky isn't a bad game. It hits all the marks it needs to. It's is an interesting experience, even if it isn't an exciting one. Indeed, I don't think a video game necessarily needs to be exciting 100% of the time to enjoy. The problem isn't so much that No Man's Sky isn't fun. Not every moment in a game needs to be fun, either. The problem is that it's not engaging. It's fantastic presentation can't hide the fact that there isn't much to do in No Man's Sky, and the game isn't really giving you an incentive to keep doing things. The core engagement of the game is likely to be lost after a few hours of play. If it had more depth to its narrative, it's gameplay or provided more things to do then No Man's Sky would be a great game. There's a lot of potential here, No Man's Sky just doesn't live up to it. The sheer size of the game is amazing. As a tech piece, No Man's Sky succeeds. The game is gargantuan and it's massive. It's likely the biggest, most technologically impressive game I've ever seen.

Maybe console gamers are used to this, or maybe it just worked better on consoles, but as a PC player, I want simple functions, like being able to look up and down with the mouse.  In PoP, you can't even freelook with the mouse unless you press a special key to enter first person mode.  The mouse and keyboard provides so many efficient camera control methods that there is no excuse for not getting this right.  The camera angle in Prince of Persia shifts every five seconds or so.  Seriously.  I never got used to it while playing the whole game.  This caused me to die numerous times while fighting or trying to make a precise jump, as the ""left"" key would suddenly become ""up"".  Perhaps console gamers are more used to this, but it drove me beserk.
Then there's the controls.  This game was just not made for a mouse and keyboard.  I hated the battles in this game because of the controls.  Between the controls and the camera angles, I found that combat basically becomes a crude mouse-clicking affair, where you occasionally hit the ""E"" key to finish off prone enemies or freeze them.  I could never quite get the Prince to do what I wanted him to do.  There's an enemy to my right.  Press ""D"" to move right and Left Click to attack.  So the Prince wheels around and attacks a guy behind him instead.  These types of moments will repeatedly pop up during combat and force you to get killed.  Until you discover the overpowered Wall Spring move, which kills everyone in one hit.  Even if you have done that, sometimes the Princess that you are escorting around gets stuck annoyingly in a group of enemies and gets killed.
What a shame, because I wanted to love this otherwise outstanding game.  In this game you get to play the ultimate acrobatic hero.  The Prince has a lot of cool moves, and they never get old to pull off or watch.  His animations are so smooth, that they are incredible to watch.  Every room is filled with traps, levers, or deep chasms and ultimately presents a puzzle to be solved.  There is a very satisfying challenge in figuring out how to use all of the Prince's special abilities to navigate across each area.  Solving the puzzles in the game is immensely satisfying.
The story doesn't sound like much on paper, but like many games, it's the way that you are immersed in the story that makes it great.  The chivalrous, brave young man gets the beautiful girl and saves the day.  It's not entirely original, but it's just so well done here.  The Prince and The Princess exchange a lot of dialog, and that is what makes the romance between them so enjoyable, and also believable.  It's hard to not like both characters.
But playing this game was like having a great dream -- and then getting woken up by the alarm clock.  The control and camera issues get in the way of so many potentially great moments.

When talking to friends about the game, I have frequently mentioned how cool it would be to have a Sims game that takes you away from the standard ""doll house"" suburbia scenario.  I mean, how hard would it be to make a medieval Sims, you know?

So enter Castaway Stories.  The concept has so much potential.  No longer does your sim just exist in a house and have a job.  Now he/she must survive.  From climbing up banana trees to spear fishing to having a pet monkey, Castaway seemingly starts out as that breath of fresh air so desperately needed in the series.  This game is completely unique from all the other expansions AND ""stories.""  New interactions, new goals, new game focus.

This was my initial impression as I played through the preset Castaway ""story.""  And I have to admit, it sucked me in.  Then I completed the story thinking ""at last, now I can really have some fun in this new environment.""  Sadly, this was not to be the case.  This game is riddled with bugs.  It's like the developers never envisioned the players using the free play option.  As soon as I started to do normal interactions like hiring a maid or having children, the game became glitchy and sluggish.  My guess is that the game engine was not designed to handle more than the preset number of sims.

This guess was further supported by evidence when I went into full neighborhood view.  For both the free play and story neighborhoods, you cannot add lots.  As in, you can't put down extra houses, you can't put down any empty lots, you can't add extra commercial lots and you can't edit the currently existing commercial lots.  Ummm... what? I could sort of understand the no editing commercial lots (it would interfere with the story), but no extra houses?!?  Needless to say, this led to a very frustrating, limiting, and shallow game play.  Add to it the ever increasing amount of bugs that continued to pop up as I tried to expand and build.

So... yes.  That's pretty much the sad and depressing tale of Castaway Stories.  I should note that my experiences were based on laptop play.  I have not yet tried to install the game and play it on my desktop.  My laptop had far more than the minimum specs for the game and still these issues cropped up.

Big Brain Academy fit the bill relatively well--it features a total of 15 games and three difficulty levels that are great to relieve stress, take a quick break from something, or just sit down and enjoy.  The game does, however, have its limitations.

The first, and most obvious, drawback to the game is that--well, there are only 15 games available.  While these are enjoyable it doesn't take too long to be craving something more, and I've found that this game plays well for short periods of time but isn't entertaining for more than about twenty to thirty minutes at a time.

The inane chatter gets in the way sometimes too--I'd rather just focus on playing the games.  Does anyone really buy these things expecting a storyline or some sort of plot?  There are 3 modes of play--practice, test, and multiplayer--which provides some variety in the gameplay as well.  The test mode selects a game from each of the five categories and gives you an overall ""brain weight""--basically a score you can work on improving--and draws a graph showing which areas you were strongest and weakest in.

It's great to have a game like this for a handheld.  Big Brain is great for killing 15 minutes of time in a waiting room or while you're waiting for someone to arrive, etc, but I wouldn't plan on long stretches of entertainment (at least for me).

Much of their beef has to do with the game's lack of depth...which is a valid criticism. So far I've played Untold Legends for a total of 12 hours and I can barely remember the names of important NPCs, locations or the types of quests I've been on.

But, really, I can say the same for games like Diablo 2 or Fate. . Untold Legends pretends to be one thing and one thing only - an unadulterated dungeon slog. You pick up some weapons and armor, a few power-ups, and go kill stuff. The plot is secondary, maybe even tertiary, to the fighting. And as far as the killing goes, there's plenty of it to do and Sony Online Entertainment makes sure its fun.

Yeah, Diablo 2 had some great cutscenes. I remember playing Diablo 2 just to GET to the next cutscene. You won't find that level of story depth here. The purpose of your quests are simply to get you to the next dungeon so you can kill stuff.

The game is structured much like Diablo. Town is where you go to buy, sell, get quests and receive rewards for a job well done. Most of your non-magical items like weapons and armour are ""socketed"", and you can enhance these weapons with runes, jewels or skulls to pump up your stats or get special abilities/attacks. Inventory is handled much like Diablo, but with much improvement. You needn't move stuff around just to get more space in your pack. The game handles that for you. Unlike Diablo, you don't have a stash. So saving multiple items that you can't use yet gets to be a pain.

Some pointers - (a) Save and save often. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the dungeon or quest, and lose all your loot and XP in the process. (b) Some bugs here and there. The one that really had me swearing was the ""Return to Aven"" bug, where the mini-disc just keeps spinning after choosing to return to town. Another reason to save like there's no tomorrow. (c)  Any experienced gamer will tell you to NEVER ever barge into a room. Certainly true here. Its easy to get overwhelmed by multiple creatures, especially at the beginning of the game. (d) Don't get frustrated during the first few levels. The difficulty ramps up slowly. Provided some careful distribution of stat points and judicious attention paid to your armour/weapons, you'll be an effective bringer-of-death within short order.

It's free roam again, ala GTA. The graphics are awesome, detailed and great looking. The gameplay never gets boring. Even if you have to swing all the way across New York City, it's still fun to watch. The fighting moves have gotten a nice tune-up and There's all sorts of new enemies to tackle. There is a new button system but don't worry, Bruce Campbell will once again guide you through all the fundamentals.

Now, as I mentioned in the title, there's no replay. What I mean is, once you complete the game, you can't start over and play through the missions again. You can do it once more, as the black suited Spidey but after that, you basically have to erase your saved game in order to play through it again.

I just have to laugh everytime I'm in battle with them because they're so retarded.

This game is highly recommended by me but if you can't get you hands on the collector's edition, it's nothing to hold out for, just get the regular version.

Unfortunately, the story mode is what drags this title under the bus. It is absolutely horrendous. You go through a `what if' story involving the original Trunks in his own timeline battling the revitalized Majin Buu. The dialogue can be long at times, and though I'm a huge Dragon Ball Z fan, I found it better to just skip it all together and go straight into the fights. There's another problem. When in play you're taken to an overworld map in which you fly to destinations. The map is also chalk full of enemies, and if any of them bump into you, get ready to fight. At times you will end up having to fight the same character numerous times just to advance, and if other enemies are in the map, get ready for a serious duel between the game and your patience. I found it wise to just skip the entire story mode and download a save file that was already 100% completed.

But I wouldn't pay much attention to them. Just think about it, if the game was that broken and hard to play it wouldn't have sold as many as it would and it wouldn't be as popular as it is. A lot of the things said, like about securom, or drm or validation, all those things... They're such a small thing that people like that are just blowing something way out of proportion and 99% of other people wouldn't and don't even care or notice.

So, that being said... I had a hard time when I was first playing this game. I got this when it first came out and I never really got into the game, I would play it for maybe a few days, get bored of it and uninstall it. But for some reason I kept coming back to the game. But the same thing would happen, I'd get bored and uninstall it. It wasn't until earlier this year when I reinstalled it again and started playing it... But this time things were different. For some reason I was completely sucked into the game and within one very long night I finished it and I was simply amazed with the great story, the lovely ending, the fantastic game play and I kept thinking to myself... Why didn't I experience this earlier?

This game has got a lot of really good qualities and, for most people, is worth your money. It's like a really good movie, it might not be something you play again and again and again.. But it's something that you'll always remember, cherish and love.

There's a great deal of combat that is by far one of the best that I've ever played in a third person rpg, games like the witcher and others like it don't even come close. You have a squad of 2 other people (3 in total, including yourself), there's 6 other characters you can choose to have in your party (Not at first, you meet them as you go along in the story).

The action is just like a normal shooter, you can use cover, shoot, run around, order your teammates to move to certain areas, use specific skills, all in all it works together wonderfully and flows very well and it's just a blast.

The inventory system is great, you don't have to worry about ""Oh no, I only have 1 slot left but there's 3 items here I want to pick up"". Loot everything you can, because space is not an issue - which is a godsend in this game. You can get things to attach to your weapons, things that will regenerate your health, give you better accuracy, do elemental damage, etc. It's really fun, it's not just weapons too, you can also upgrade your armor and other things.

While the graphics are nice with some really awe inspiring visuals at times (Ok, almost awe inspiring) the audio in this game is just as good. With the sounds from the weapons or just things passing by, to the music and ambient sounds.. It really sells where you're at, what's going on and what you're doing.

But what really set this game apart, for me, was the story.

Now... I've never been much of a ""story"" driven guy, at least in regards to games. But if you can make it past just the first two or three hours of the game, things start to get interesting and start to really get good. I kept on wanting to find out what would happen next and even though I was fighting my own fatigue and wanted to go to bed, I just couldn't get myself to leave my desk and leave this game unfinished. I kept telling myself, ""Just 5 more minutes"" or ""Once I finish this last thing and find out what happens here"".

The ending in this game was by far one of the best that I've experienced in a few years, next to call of duty 4 among others. I felt like I had just taken part in a great movie when this was finished and that's how it is with many people I've talked to about this game. They just love it.

This game does have a few problems, for one... You're going to need quite a decent rig to play this, even at low settings sometimes. Some of my friends couldn't even play this game because it ran so slowly at times. Also, this can definitely be a hard game for some people (like me) to get into. But it's worth it if you stick it out and play it through the end. It can also be pretty difficult at times, but thankfully... You can change the difficulty if there's a part you simply can't get past.

Also, if you spend your time doing side quests (Which is easy to get caught up in doing without even really realizing it) you might end up losing the will to go on, which seemed to be the case for me all the times I tried playing this before. So this time I decided to simply just do the main mission and follow through and boy am I glad I did.

There's a few minor things like that but overall this is just an extremely fun game, a very rewarding game. However, there isn't much replay value. Once you finish this, you're probably done. There's a few things you can download, like the Bring Down the Sky, which is free dlc. But there isn't much to keep you playing once it's all said and done. But like I said, it's like a great movie you might watch once every now and then... But it's definitely worth the price.","Hard to start, but boy what an ending.",1256169600,5,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

A combination of great mechanics and stellar songs made the game irresistible to anyone who found Dance Dance Revolution a little less accessible.  If you haven't been in a coma the last few years, you have to had at least heard of the game.  If you're one of those people who haven't, however, this is as good of a time as any to pick up the axe and start shredding.

The Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero II comes in at the steep price of $90, $20 higher than it's Playstation 2 predecessor.  Of course, Xbox 360 owners are well accustomed to higher prices for their games.  But if you're going to shell out close to $100 for a video game, you better hope that that money is well-spent.  So is it?

Well, yes and no.  If you already own the Playstation 2 version of the game, I really can't recommend this purchase.  The game plays identical to that version, and the majority of the songs are the same.  What the Xbox 360 version offers over the PS2 version, however, is high-definition graphics, an additional 10 tracks to master (with the promise of more to be available for download at a later date)and Xbox Live support of Leaderboards and Achievement Points.  If wanting to see where you stack up against the rest of the world is important to you, or if you've already worn out all the songs on the PS2, you might want to consider making the jump.  But still, $90 to play a few new songs is asking a lot.

Having played both versions, I'd say the biggest drawback to the Xbox 360 version of the game is that there is no multiplayer support over Xbox Live.  Whether it's an issue of laziness or cost, I'm not sure.  But $90 is a lot to pay when you're getting a bare bones version of what you're used to getting on Xbox Live.  This is my biggest complaint about the game.  Spending an extra $50 or $60 on an extra guitar for multiplayer is a big investment.  The lack of Live support for multiplayer is extremely disheartening.

Overall, Guitar Hero II is still a fantastic game, and if you can afford it you definitely need to check it out on Xbox 360.  Especially if you haven't played it yet.  With the additions of Leaderboards and Achievement points, and downloadable content, this is definitely the best version of the game yet!  But if you already own it on PS2, you might want to wait until a price drop comes around.  $90 is simply too much for a game that you already own.

I'm not familiar with any previous games in the series before, but I was overall pleased with this game.  It's suprisingly addictive and has it's own strong appeal and charm.  The real time combat was a nice change from all the traditional turn based that seems to dominate most RPGs, and the I love the idea of the game being played twice--once from the female character's perspective, and once from the male's.  Particularly since they don't go all the same places together; at many points, each go through different dungeons, which are only accessible through that character's side of the story.

Unfortunately, the game is not without it's flaws.  The graphics aren't always necessarily the best--the characters seem to have a hard time moving their legs when they walks sideways, at times.  I grew frustrated with only being able to save my game at the Goddess statues, and even more so by the fact that when my character dies, the game ends.  And with how easy it was for characters to be killed in the fun but flawed combat, I found myself tired of doing the same dungeons over and over again.  Also, while having two people participating in the real time combat is a good idea, it, overall, proves to be a waste.  The second person (whomever happens to be following your character at the time) is worthless, and usually wanders around, attacking only monsters that you attack, and being killed far too quickly and easily.  And the only way to control that character is to relinquish control of the first character.

With the weapons, it is an interesting change to have the hot house where you can use seeds collected from the game and have the blacksmith there temper your weapons, but I prefer the more straight forward weapon progression; where you simply buy or find a weapon or piece of armor that is simply stronger than anything previous.  The same can be said for the spirits; cool, but mostly useless, except for a few key points during the game.  The only one I ever really used was the one that healed.

Overall, I think it's a very fun, appealing sort of game.  It only took three weeks to beat, so it's nothing for the hard-core gamer.  But it's a fun jaunt, nonetheless.",Not bad,1105488000,5,,

4.0,True,"03 19, 2017",A22K08WPR5LLJO,B00ZQC73O8,Burt Reynolds,"This game deserves all the praise it is getting.  There are many reasons why you should buy this title now instead of waiting a year for a price drop.

First, the story, although not remarkable by any standard, is nevertheless rational.  The overall story arc is one of revenge or vengeance.  Alloy's drive makes sense, and her determination (which is principally fueled by a personal loss) is believable.  The voice acting isn't amazing.  It's good enough so that it does not distract from the gameplay.  In sum, the story and voice acting are above average and good.

Second, the graphics are excellent.  On the PS4 Pro, with HDR enabled and on a true 4K TV, the lighting effects and colors really impress.  At first I thought the world was simply one-toned: green bushes and trees surrounded by snow-capped mountains.  To my pleasant surprise, as you go from one large map area to another you begin to see significant climate changes.  You'll go from a forest setting to snowy mountains to desert to rough mountains, and a lot in between.  Each large city has its own culture and particular architecture.  For example, you see that Alloy's people are much more mystic and ""savage"" than other parts of the map.  Other large city-states may have huge cities and much larger populations.  You get the impression those areas are less mystic--which comes through quite well since when those people mention where Alloy comes from, they do so with some sarcasm.  Overall, the graphics and world are pretty well fleshed out.

Third, the gameplay is fun and addictive.  It's fun to use bow and arrows and ""primitive"" machine gun-type weapons against these giant, extremely powerful machines.  You must use cunning to take down an enemy that is significantly bigger, more power, and sometimes faster than you.  There are some instances where the gameplay gets repetitive.  However, I think the developers did a fairly good job varying the enemy types.  Is most RPG games the enemies are very one-note.  Here, you constantly discover new enemies, each with their own weaknesses and strengths.  You learn that what easily brought down one enemy type simply will not work for another.  You have to spend time scanning and watching and thinking of new ways to destroy different enemy types.

I think HZD is an excellent start to a new IP.  I'm looking forward to the next game, and hope the developers can build upon this.  The story could do with a reworking--Naughty Dog is superb with that, and there's no reason why HZD 2 couldn't follow suit.  HZD is also not a true RPG.  I think taking it that direction would be a great thing.  Having the ability to fully create, modify, and live as your own character in this rich world would make the replayability obvious.  HZD currently probably won't get much replay value because the character and traits simply aren't set up for that.

Presentation

The menu is a little blah. Not great, not horrible, it's just kinda there. It in no means takes away from the greatness of the game, but it certainly doens't add to it.

9.0 Graphics

For a launch title this game is pretty incredible in terms of graphics. The first couple chapters of the game don't look as good as the rest (like 5% of the game). I don't know why, it just does.

9.5 Sound

The sound of the game is amazing and really adds to a realistic gaming experience. Things sound like they're are right in the room next to you. It really adds to the mood of the game.

8.0 Gameplay

The gameplay of this game is great, don't get me wrong, but it is pretty short. This is my only real gripe of this game. There is so much more the game could have had. It was great as is however.

7.5 Lasting Appeal

This game doesn't scream lasting appeal. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but it lacks certain things that could make it last longer. No mulitplayer, no Live aspects (except achievments), etc.

First, let me praise this little data animal. Golden Sun's graphics are top notch, improving (im my opinion) drastically over its predecessor. The summon spells look great, although they seem useless, and in fact I think that using them can HINDER your chances to win big battles, but they do look great. The number of hidden secrets is incredible, ranging from optional superbosses to top-notch summons to weapons dropped only by monsters. For the fun factor, this game ranks up there with the best - as far as the puzzles go, I would rank them with those found in Zelda and Lufia.
So, where's the problem? Well, unfortunately, GS2 is obviously not the end of the story, a fact which becomes painfully obvious early in the game. Whereas the first GS introduced us to this incredible new RPG universe, and the surely-upsoming GS3 will resolve the conflict for good, this game trudges along story-wise, simply playing through events in order to lead to the bolckbuster finale. I would liken this to the recent ""Attack of the Clones""; this game's story is here merely to deliver events until the third game can be released. And for that, I knock off a star.
Oh, but maybe I'm nitpicking. I honestly haven't enjoyed PLAYING an RPG like this in a long time, and here's hoping that we get a few more like this.

Gameplay is easy and intuitive for anyone who has played classic point and click games. Graphics are nice, ran smoothly even on a laptop with a 1.4ghz celeron processor and an ATI Radeon Express 200M integrated graphics card. (If you aren't particualrly hardware savvy that means I played it with no problems on a fairly low spec machine)

The central character is very interesting, a psychiatrist who is brilliant with his patients but almost totally dysfunctional when interacting with amyone else. He isn't entirely sympathetic which is unusual for the 'hero'in a game like this but unfortunately you don't get to find out exactly why he is the way he is, just one of the loose ends that were mentioned in another review.

The backstory progresses by means of triggering memories in each of the 5 patients by playing them recordings of what other patients have revealed. This can get pretty tedious once you have built up a store of recordings and sometimes you just have to go through all of them to get a response. The backstory however IS intriguing, right up until you actually solve the final puzzle where the game just kind of fizzles out and leaves you hanging as to what you have actually achieved.

Despite my reservations I actually enjoyed this game which is why it gets 4 stars. The character of Macnamara is one of the best created in recent years and the plot draws you along as it is revealed in tiny increments after each flashback. The missing star is due to the ending and also the fact that there is one point in the game where you cannot progress if you have not performed a very minor action earlier on in the game - dead ends should be a thing of the past in these kind of games.",Good game with a few flaws,1212883200,5,,

 This is a 2D sidescroller game, and your quest in each level is to get to the star. There are, of course obstacles. Let's say the star is on a high ledge that you can't jump to. You simply write ""ladder"" and POOF a ladder appears. You climb up the ladder. Done!

If there's a pile of dirt you type ""shovel"" to create a shovel and dig. If there's a fish to catch, you type ""fishing pole"".

There's no one way to solve any puzzle. I had a star that fell onto a spike and got damaged. I typed ""igloo"" to put an igloo over the spike. The star slid safely off the igloo and was fine! Your creativity is really challenged. Especially because you earn points for re-solving levels in different ways.

It's not a big surprise, but in a game with this kind of innovative undertaking there are all sorts of annoying problems. Take ladders. Ladders for some reason do not work sturdily. They wobble and fall. Placing objects on the screen is often an exercise in frustration. I had an angry dog to get past. I made a leash and put it on the dog. So far so good. Then I tried *all* sorts of objects to connect the other end of the leash too. The dog would just drag them along. They wouldn't stick in the ground. If I tried to hammer a spike in the ground, I ""attacked"" the spike instead.

I could make tranquilizer, but not use it on the dog. Often in these levels you get frustrated and just make a bear and take care of the dog (or other creature) in a hostile way - but I don't like to do that.

The camera controls are really frustrating as well. You can scroll to look around the level, but it instantly snaps back to your main character. I would like the camera to simply go where I want it to go.

There is a level editor in here, which is a fun idea, and there are a ton of different situations to try, so there is no dearth of things to figure out. The problem is you have to feel excited to try them all. Once you start getting frustrated by the game, it's almost a chore to pick it up and struggle with the next one.

An awesome concept. I really give them the highest marks for making such an open-ended game. I love the ability to have your main character be a bride and other characters, too.

Well everyone raves about the water scenes but my favorites are the interior river canyon scenery, absolutely gorgeous pastels...almost painting like. You can also see forever with this engine.

As far as play goes, its the usual FPS. You go from one point to the next accomplishing objectives and shooting up the place.

However the action is great and 75% of it takes place outdoors in beautifully colored scenery rather then in some dingy castle dungeon. It borrows from several other games, notably ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"". Yes, uber like super soldiers/humans are in the mix and you will be attempting to shut them down.

The game had been well reviewed by critics, was part of a long line of amazing games, and had supposedly made some great changes to the formula to start fresh with things like hex tiles and non-stacking units.  I had been excited about the game, but then almost considered not getting it.

Having broken down and purchased the game, and played it for a solid month now, I can tell you that a lot of the poor reviews are way off-base.  There was a lot of expectation for this game, because Civ IV had been such a masterpiece, and the initial release of this game was horribly buggy and imbalanced.  It has been regularly patched since then, however, and in fact was just patched on March 1st.  In it's current state, the game no longer crashes frequently (I have actually never experienced a single crash on my modest laptop, and I run that game at max settings), the in-between turn times are now minimal, and overall the game has been much more balanced to allow Domination, Cultural, or Scientific victories (Diplomatic victories are still kind of dumb... you may want to disable them).

So that negates a lot of the issues that people had with this game when giving it negative reviews.  Another that I have seen: Civ V can only be played online!  This is flat out not true.  You need to be online to download Steam if you don't have it, and then to download and install the game.  Then you can simply set Steam to work in offline mode and play the game regardless of if you have an internet connection.  Another gripe: you can't skip the opening cinematic!  Again, not true.  The cinematic masks a loading screen.  Hit space bar or escape as soon as you see the cinematic.  As soon as the game finishes loading, the cinematic will cut off and you'll reach the menu.

So I've spent a lot of time debunking the complaints.  How about things that are actually great about this game?  No more ""stacks of doom""!  That's right.  You or the AI cannot simply load 15 units into an unbeatable stack and destroy everything on the map!  Now that units don't stack, you need to be strategic in your placement of cavalry, archers, infantry, and artillery.  Combat in this game is the best of any Civ game, hands down.  Cities are no longer vulnerable for easy taking, but can defend themselves quite well from attack.  Units can attack from a range, or maneuver around the hex tiles for a tactical advantage.  You will no longer be told you have >99% chance of winning a battle, only to lose it.  A spearman will never beat a tank! (unless that tank is really REALLY wounded)

City management has also been streamlined quite a bit, I think for the better.  If you don't want to stress about which tiles get worked, which specialists are active, etc -- don't!  The game will smartly take care of this for you.  Or you can set your city to a specific focus (i.e. production, food, gold, or culture).  Or you can roll up your sleeves and micromanage everything it does.  The choice is up to you!  A lot of key Civ features like Science/Culture/Gold sliders are gone.  You need to actually put some thought into how you build your cities so that these issues can't be fixed with the flick of a mouse.  For better or worse, a lot of other familiar features like War Weariness, Health, Pollution, and Religion are gone.  Basically, this is an entirely new game, and it's unfair to compare it to Civ II or IV and hate it just because some of the features you like have been removed.

Have I mentioned that this game is absolutely beautiful?  Especially with a high end video card (which I sadly do not have, but my GF does), the leader animations are magnificent, the landscape is gorgeous, and the animations are detailed and realistic (try setting off a Nuclear Missile and see if your jaw doesn't hit the floor).  A ton of work went into the art design in this game, and even minor things like the circular picture for each technology or the mini icon for each military unit are well-thought out and unique.

A few criticisms, though, because honestly this game still needs a few patches and maybe an expansion to be perfect.  Diplomacy is simply not very good.  The AI is constantly hostile, and there is little you can do to improve relations. Diplomatic Victory is a case of buying enough votes to win the UN election (quite easy to do or have done to you).  Multiplayer is still a bit of a mess, with no LAN or hotseat support, and an extremely stripped-down game if you play over the internet.  But I have confidence that a lot of these problems will be fixed by Firaxis and 2k games, as they have already done a superb job of addressing the Civ community's complaints, and improving their product on a steady basis.  And oh yeah: tired of the civs you can play with?  Shell out a few extra bucks for extra downloadable civs and scenarios.  Polynesia releases tomorrow.

I'm not writing this to attack the 1 and 2 star reviewers... everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I just want everyone to give this game a fair chance, because it really is something special, and has the potential to be the greatest Civ game in the series.  Personally, I'm in no rush for Civ 6... I want to enjoy this game while it's still fresh and exciting.  Once you start playing, it's impossible not to get sucked into the familiar ""One More Turn!"" addiction.

4.0,True,"10 16, 2014",A5ZQ92W2LNZEW,B00JDOX2PE,Peanut,"So having almost finished my first playthrough my first impressions of the pre-sequal are...""It's good...not great"".  The game does do quite a few things right. The addition of O2 which drains over time as you walk the lunar surface concerned me a little, but, I found I actually enjoyed the machanic-it is differnet, the double jump can be useful at times, and if one does not pay attention, an empty O2 tank can mean extra damage to the player mid gunfight (the kind of double edge sword that belongs in a BL title). the banter from several of the main characters had me cracking up now and again. The weapons and the combat are excellent as can be expected ,and, the loot tables seem more generous than in the predecessor which is fine by me.

That said the game is short, not only is it short, it FEELS short. Side quests not withstanding  the pre-sequal feels about as long as tiny tina's DLC from BL2. This gives the story a very rushed vibe and hardly takes the time to develope the charicters. As an example the main villian is forgettable at best, she has a big intro, and not really much else to do with the game at all...there is a showdown, and an established threat but other than that she's a footnote. The taunts and wit of jack from bl2 over the echo added dimension to the character that just wasn't there for the pre-sequal big baddie.

Similarly to the primary antagonist the scavs where dull...how many of us remeber hitting a rat in bl2 with a fire weapon and hearing him scream ""I SMELL DELICIOUS!!!"" or comments from psychos concerning meat bicycles, their pounds of flesh, etc. these disturbing personality traits are hardly a presence in the pre-sequal (one exception being Jack...he's still got it) and I found that without these iconic doses of insanity I got bored faster. The humorous moments are few and really leave a void in the experience in my opinion as it becomes just another fps with a few gimmiks.

Still it is a borderlands title, and for the most part fits into the franchise well enough. With a bit of flare, and window dressing, and a touch more story, the pre-sequal would have been a contender to it's predecessors. but as it stands it is more a case of highly polished filler as we await the next title in the franchise.",IT'S BORDERLANDS!!! -ish...,1413417600,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.

A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -

HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.

It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Rainbow Six Siege includes both R6 Vegas Xbox 360 games, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]

It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.

Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.

External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.

The bundles-

The current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it. Legacy consoles shouldnt be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven't included, due to their rarity at this point). You may have better luck at other outlets finding the legacy consoles (Microsoft Store, Dell, various brick-and-mortar stores). There are no functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).

Current bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -

Spring Note - It's hard to recommend anything other than the Kinect bundle (if you want the camera peripheral), the Eilte (for the controller and faster HDD, if that's most important to you) or the Spring bundle (sold at Gamestop or Microsoft Store) which includes a 1TB console, Halo 5, Ori and the Blind Forest, Rare Replay, and Gears of War Ultimate downloads. Until the end of the month, the retail price of all bundles is $50 off. If you want to know more about all the rest, see the descriptions below.

Rainbow Six Siege 1TB bundle. $399. Includes console, new controller, disc version of the title game and downloads of the Rainbow Six Vegas Xbox 360 games, with a chat headset. A new class-based multiplayer shooter with the excellent tactical precursor campaigns. A good bundle. A- rating.

The Division Bundle 1TB bundle. $399. Includes console, new controller, download of the title game. No headset, no legacy games. B- rating.

Quantum Break 500GB White bundle. $349. Includes console, new controller, and downloads of Quantum Break and both Alan Wake 360 games. No headset. B+ rating.

Name your Game 500GB bundle. $349. Includes the console, new controller, a download of one of Forza 6, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Gears of War Ultimate, or Rare Replay, and no chat headset. The choice of games is nice and the selections are high-quality, but 500GB will fill very quickly at this point, and without a headset or bonus games, this is one of the lesser value bundles. B- rating.

Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers, and DOES include a chat headset with a matching black and silver color scheme. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller has been released to wide acclaim (modifiable professional controllers can easily go for twice as much), but is scarce on its own at present. If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it. B+ rating. Please note that the bundle with two controllers does not include a second Elite controller, but a regular wireless one.

Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage. Bundle with FIFA on separate page is even better for the same price.

Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc, Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included. Now replaced by the even better Spring bundle (see above).

Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only. C rating.

Gears of War 500GB bundle (also in white). $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download. This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B- rating. This is the most discounted bundle in sales and has many other offers with it, if you can catch them.

Legacy bundles-

Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.

Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel is even better, but I haven't tried it yet. Great for adults who love action adventure.

Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.

FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.

Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom (new, with 3.5mm audio jack) controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.

But... other than being gorgeous, the game simply lacks gameplay.

The missions are all very easy. The enemies are all very easy and the gameplay must have been geared to a younger group of players than me (I'm on my early 20s). The only true enemy of Spiderman in this game is water.  All the fights are easy, Rhino, and all of them... just fall very easily (and there aren't even that many of the more special enemies that try to make it challenging).  The only truly difficult parts of the game are the ones that involve water, the duel over the statue of liberty and the final battle against Dr Ock both involve the constant risk of falling on water and since that kills you at once it is the only true challenge in the game.  I find that annoying and frankly a bit old.

The side quests such as finding sckyscraper special locations and stuff are a good idea (reminds me of Grand Theft Auto), but frankly there is no payoff. You find all of them and all you get is a medal on your status screen saying you did it.  Who cares? There are so many things that could have been added such as different costumes for Spidey, changes to Peter's apt, and etc. (Again, similar things have been done before for example in GTA).

The random missions are very repetitive (by the 8-9 time a armored car was being robbed it got to be pretty boring).

The game still is pretty funny though, the voices are made by the actors from the movie so they are great.

I just wish they had spent some of the time they used making the amazing NY in the game creating some more story and gameplay instead.

The 9/11 memorial in the game was a pretty neat and sensitive inclusion though.","Technically a fantastic game, but lacks gameplay",1118793600,,,

I am also very familiar with the latest 80GB model (which is basically this one with a larger disk) because one of my neighbors has one and I am the neighborhood's unofficial and unpaid 'computer' consultant :). I did some research in anticipation of us purchasing a second unit because I promised the kids 'their own' if their grades were going to meet a certain standard.

______________________________________________

STORAGE and STORAGE UPGRADE:
----------------------------
This model comes with an 40GB drive. As crazy as this may sound, this is the best machine your money can buy today IF you are planning to upgrade and IF you dig MGS4. On the other hand, DO NOT buy this model if you do not consider upgrading the disk because 40GB won't take you very far.

To give you an idea of the amount of storage you may need on your PS3, I recently checked the status of my 320GB disk and I found that I had 198GB free. That means that, one year after purchasing my (then) 60GB box I was using 122GB already. The space is taken by family pictures, a little music, lots of demos, many 'disk' games that dump gigabytes of data to the disk to improve performance, many videos the kids are making with the 'Eye' camera, game saves. I suspect that 'Home', when it becomes available, may require a few more GB's for its own use so 320GB may be what you need if you don't want to constantly worry about deleting old stuff before you run out of space.

If you are on the upgrade path, $100 would buy you a 320GB drive. I used the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Digital-WD3200BEVT-320-GB-Scorpio-Sata-5400-Rpm-8MB-2-5-inch/dp/B0011U65F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Digital WD3200BEVT 320 GB Scorpio Sata 5400 Rpm 8MB 2.5 inch</a>&nbsp;myself. 1TB drives are available these days for a few $$ more and you should try to get one of those if you are planning to store lots of videos. The nice thing about upgrading your disk is that you are also going to be left with a perfectly good 40GB drive which you can place into a cheap enclosure, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/StarTech-AT2510U2-InfoSafe-2-5-Inch-USB-SATA-Hard-Drive-Enclosure/dp/B000PKC102/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">StarTech AT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosure</a>&nbsp;worked for me. I am using the free leftover drive as a backup device for family photos.

Upgrading the disk is (relatively) easy and you can find a lot of advice on the Net. Search for ""PlayStation 3 Hard Drive Upgrade (HOWTO)"" for a nice video so you'll decide if you are comfortable with it. If upgrading is the first thing you do, everything becomes very easy because you need not worry about backups or restores. I upgraded my box in a couple of hours WITH the backup/restore steps.

MEMORY CARD INTERFACES:
-----------------------
The lack of memory card interfaces is annoying but you can get around it. Copy your stuff to a USB drive or flash drive and... problem solved. You can then upload your things through the USB. It's somewhat inconvenient but it's no big deal.

USB PORTS:
----------
My old 60GB model has 4 USB ports and I am using all of them. One for the PS3 Eye (camera), a second has a wireless keyboard dongle, the third is where the racing wheel plugs in and the last one I use to charge controllers. Of course, you can and you WILL be able to live with 2 slots but it is likely that you will be doing some plugging/unplugging if you begin adding peripherals. One way around it is to get a USB port multiplexer. Another solution is seek Bluetooth peripherals (wireless) if you can find them. Bluetooth keyboards, for example, are available.

PS2 COMPATIBILITY:
------------------
This model does not support PS2 software. Since the original PS2-compatible PS3's are hard to get, this has to be accepted as reality. I assume that Sony, after polling existing and future PS3 users, found that most users don't need PS2 compatibility. Soon after we upgraded to a PS3 my kids were playing Kingdom Hearts and Destroy All Humans but I haven't seen them doing so in quite a while. It is nice to have PS2 compatibility but its lacking would not stop me from buying a PS3.

PSOne GAMES:
------------
The PS3 has full PSOne compatilibity. Lots of them are available for download at the PSN store. They are quite inexpensive and some of them are still fun to play.

SUMMARY:
--------
- If you like MGS4 and you consider upgrading, buy THIS model.
- If you are planning to upgrade regardless, you're better off with this model because you can use the $100 you save to upgrade, you get the MGS4 and you should be able to get Drake's Fortune (new) for about $40 from Amazon. Not to mention that you don't have to wait for 3 more weeks.
- If you don't care much about MGS4 AND you feel that you can live with 160GB AND you think Drake's Fortune is a cool game, then wait for a few more weeks for the 160GB bundle.

Note: I am not taking off one star for the lack of PS2 compatibility. I understand that Sony must compete on price and make a profit and times are tough. However, I simply can't see why Sony cut the number of USB ports from 4 down to 2 and this explains why this unit gets 4 stars instead of 5. This is a relatively significant inconvenience and I can't see how it would cost Sony more than a dollar or 2 if it provided 4 ports instead of 2.","Great collector's item, PERFECT choice for a disk upgrade",1225929600,117,,

My initial impressions were fairly negative, trying to adjust to all the buttons I could hit with my thumb on the side. The mouse is also quite heavy in comparison to my previous one so it took some time to be able to maneuver it consistently well.

After using this mouse for several months, I've come to like it more than I initially thought I would. Those already using a similar, heavy mouse with many buttons probably won't notice a difference. If you're switching from a standard mouse you picked up at the local Walmart, it will be a big change. I haven't used the additional functionalities of the mouse very much, but those I have worked fine. The only gripe I still have is that I hit the bottom-left button on the side accidentally more often than I would anticipate even after using the mouse this long.

A little on the repetitious side due to having such a short development time (dungeons are recycled frequently and sidequests can get pretty samey), but BioWare did the best with what they had and it came out well.

Loading times are also very long. I loaded a save file and it was taking 3-5 minutes which felt like a PS1 game. Many times you walk out a portal into an open area again, and the game auto-saves which is annoying (and long) when I had saved 2 seconds prior. I'm not sure if it's just my experience but there were instances when the game's frame-rate crawls to a very slow pace, mostly during a crowded battle. The game literally stopped moving except for the part where it says ""attacking, moving"" etc next to your party members' names.

You know, I find it kind of sad that games today have nowhere near this level of sprite and animation quality, despite the obvious jumps in technology.

Everything from the hand drawn backrounds to the exceptional backround music just screams quality and dedication. I'm even more impressed that the game sounds as good as it does despite the Megadrive's lackluster sound chip.

The only problem I guess I have is how short the game is, around 10 stages and most stages take only 5-7ish minutes to complete tops. I do however, like that the game isn't exceptionally brutal on the difficulty like other Disney/Virgin Interactive games(namely Lion King, screw that stampede stage).

Kinda sad that Virgin Interactive went defunct in 2003, whenever they worked with Disney they always managed at the very least a good game. Sadly, the last few games they released were absolute tosh and despite helping Capcom with Dino Crisis and Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, they just couldn't stay afloat.

Anyway, I highly reccomend you to at least try the Jungle Book out, hell you can get it for all of 4$ on Amazon. That's a couple hours of fun for less than the cost of a bag of Doritoes.(And god have mercy on your soul if you eat the mountain dew flavored ones...uggg)

But when I saw it on CNN's Top Ten Video Games of 2003 (Or was it 2004? I can't remember...actually, I believe it was 2003.) I was blown away. I then told myself I had to get this game. I played it for the first time at a friend's house. Then I borrowed it from another friend. And then, at long last, I bought it for myself. And up to this day I still play it. It's fun, addictive, and challenging.

There are two difficulty levels in this game: ""Kids"", which is for beginners, and ""Adults"" (hence the Teen rating for this game, although it's not ""Adults Only"" material) which is for Viewtiful Joe veterans who have already beaten ""Kids"" or people who want a good challenge.

The story of this game is cliche, but still good. Joe and his girlfriend Silvia are out on a movie date, watching Joe's favorite movie, ""Captain Blue"". Suddenly, one of the movie's villians attacks, taking Silvia into the movie itself. Joe involuntarily enters the movie himself, where he is granted superpowers by Captain Blue himself. Joe turns into a superhero called Viewtiful Joe, and he fights various baddies and solves puzzles to rescue the captured Silvia.

The gameplay is where the game really shines. Viewtiful Joe is a 2-D/3-D hybrid game, in which your goals are to beat down various enemies of the evil group called ""The Jadow"" and solve puzzles. To aid you in your quest, Captain Blue grants you 3 special powers, called ""VFX"" powers. The first one is ""Slow"", which causes everything, including enemies, to move in slow motion. While this power is triggered, you can inflict more damage on your foes. The second power is ""Mach Speed"", which kicks you into fast motion, and allows you to beat some enemies down faster. The final power in ""Zoom In"", in which you zoom in to Joe and allow him to freeze some foes and take them out effortlessly. As you play the game, you can combine your powers to help you.

The game doesn't end when you beat it. There are a few unlockables in this little wonder game that will keep you coming back for more. I have already unlocked most of the secrets in this game, and I have to say I'm mostly satisfied.

If you are consistent and can get over the annoying voice of the commentator (mini wii fit board) then you can really improve your balance and strength. The strength and balance mini games have been the most beneficial for me, and the most fun or just plain funny sometimes. I really like hola hoop and step, though I wish there were more step routines (there are only two). They make it worth having. The Yoga is alright, but don't overstrech or fall of the board because you'll hurt yourself.

Pros- Love the balance games, especially soccer heading and Penguin game. Really love hola hoop and step.

William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth.

The Good:
+ A fun story
+ An imaginative use of its characters
+ Creative worlds to explore

The Bad:
-- Too easy and short
-- The few parts that are too hard

The Ugly
? Why is Kazooie so insulting?

Story--9/10

The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, ""Who is the most beautiful of them all?"" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?

Gameplay--8/10

Here is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all?

There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing).

These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable.

Longevity--5/10

A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.",A bird in a backpack is worth more than two in a bush,1371600000,,,

At the start of the game, you buy a puppy from one of the pre-selected breeds in your version, and take him home.  There's actually different colors within each breed, as well as many different personalities.  The puppy's personality can greatly affect how it plays, and how well it can be trained.

From here on you will be feeding, watering, washing, training, walking, and so on...

Your puppy also never ages.

Walking your dog allows you to meet other dogs, increase your dog's endurance, and find items on the streets for your dog to play with.  Most everything you find early on is pretty useless, though (broken cameras, empty boxes, etc.)

Playing and training your puppy allows it to gain skills to compete in doggy games for money.  Really, the only way you can make money in the game to buy more puppies and supplies!  Not all dogs are great for the games, though... (oh, my poor slow and tiny weiner dog!!)

Train your puppy to come when you call its name and to do tricks using the voice function, and the stylus to pet the puppy when it is good.  Training was sometimes tedeous for me, and you need to make sure to speak clearly and consistantly, and to not be in a noisy place.

Use terms that don't sound at all similar, or your puppy will be confused (ie:  sit down, and lie down don't work at all.)

Really, this is a great game.  It is adorable, tons of fun, and it is an amazing use of the DS's capabilities.  More developers need to find innovative ways to use the touch screen for more than just cycling through menus.

The only thing that keeps this from being the best game ever is the same issue all interactive items of this kind have:  repetition and replay value.  This game is amazing for the first while, but it also does wear thin after a while.

Especially as you start on your second puppy, you are essentially doing the same thing all over again.

I haven't yet tried the DS version, but I can say that I have already unlocked about 20 recipes and this game is worth the money. at only about 30.00 it's pretty fun. Sure, it isn't the best game I've ever played in my life (nothing compares to Mario games) but it's still an entertaining way to spend time on the wii. Basically you cook different meals. They start you out with some basics (the meals go by cuisines from different countries) and then you unlock more as you play single player mode. This mode is very fun because Mama helps you and it's exciting to anticipate which meal you unlock next. While single player mode is fun, playing against a friend in two player mode is very entertaining; seeing who is the better cook is very fun. There is a third mode in which you play against the computer, someone representing each cuisine from a specific country. That is pretty fun if you want to challenge someone but have no friends around. Overall, I would give this game a 4. The reason being that it is difficult to control at times and the directions are not clear at first. However once you start playing the controls become pretty intuitive because you just do the actions as if you were actually stirring or chopping up ingredients. Mama's comments are hysterical and the graphics are quite cute and fit well with the game; the food looks pretty real too! You do not have to be a master chef or love to cook either. I would say this is a very nice addition to any Wii owner's collection. Other than some tough controls in the beginning, Cooking Mama is a very satisfying, enjoyable game, with or without friends.","Worth the $ for fun factor, though not the best game ever",1206748800,,,

4.0,False,"05 13, 2009",A1HVVJ1MHIX3RM,B000CNESHQ,Steven Mathews,"The first tales game I ever played was Tales of Symphonia and boy did I love it!  Then I got Tales of The Abyss and loved it equally as much.  Then a few Christmases ago I got Tales of Phantasis and well it has its ups and downs.
 As some of you may know Taales of Phantasia was the first game in the series that was released on the SNES only in Japan but it came to the US later on the PS1.  The storyline is great and the battle system is unique atleast it was at the time.  The characters are cute but not exactly ones you'd feel an attachment to.  The story begins as a quest for revenge as two boys' village is destroyed and their loved ones killed.  This eventually leads one of the boys back in time where he meets a variety of friends and foes including the game's main villian Dhaos but that's all I'll reveal to prevent totally spoiling everything.
 Gameplay is pretty basic for an RPG.  You go through towns and dongeons fighting monsters and collecting treasure nothing new in that area.  The battle system like I said is pretty unique though other reviewers have said it can be slow and laggy at times and I agree.  Another thing that I agree with is that the voice acting is really bad.  It's hard to understand most of what the characters say and the music isn't all that great either.
 Other than those flaws it's a pretty good game and if your a tales fan you'll mostlikely enjoy playing the first game in the series.  One thing I did notice was that this game has many similarities to Tales of Symphonia.  Seriously it's like it's prequal though it's only about half as long.  Despite the game's bad voices and sometomes slow battles I'm glad they brought this game over to the US so that we can experience the origin of the series.  This is also a good game to keep you busy on long trips and stuff and is in my opinion one of the best RPGs for the GBA.  So if you want a good RPG that'll keep you busy on long trips I highly recommend this game.  Though it may not be as thrilling as other tales games it's still an excellent RPG for the GBA.",An NES Classic born again on the GBA,1242172800,,,

Now it's been released for the DS but don't let this version fool you. This game is just as fun, adult, criminal and addictive to play as the PS3 and Xbox 360 console versions.

Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is an all new game based in Liberty City (Rockstar's version of NYC.) You play as Han, a young guy who just flew in to drop off an artifact for his father, the boss of a dangerous gang. He gets robbed, beat up, shot and dumped in the ocean. Of course, with your help, you break out of the car you were dumped in and see your uncle, who you will start working for. This is where the game begins as your main goal is to find out who ambushed you and who killed your father. I can say that Liberty City is huge and that would still be an understatement. Besides the main story missions, you have so much to do, it's crazy. The main thing of the game is to make money since you will need it to buy everything in this game.

Most of the story missions earn you money once you complete them. You can buy property, cars, weapons and drugs. Along the way, you will unlock other activities to do on the side: meeting and completing side missions for random strangers, complete rampage missions, earn money as a cab driver, ambulance driver or a police officer, race around the city and destroy cameras so cops don't see you dealing drugs. Oh yes, you deal drugs in this game and this along has its own elaborate system. You can seek out drug dealers who will buy drugs from you or sell drugs to you. Each of them has different types of drugs and you find out certain drugs are preferred by certain dealers depending on which part of the city they are located. Buy drugs from those who sell it cheap and then sell it to those who really want to make the maximum profit. The cycle keeps going and if you find enough of them, they will send you emails telling you what they want or what they are selling.

Oh yeah...you get emails in the game. You use a GPS-like device that shows you the map of Liberty City and as you discover all the side missions, drug dealers, racing destinations etc, they appear on the GPS in categories so save often so you can permanently record their locations. You get emails from your uncle at first that tell you when and where to start the missions. You eventually meet other people that work with your uncle and you get missions from them as well via email. As a bonus, when you beat all of the story missions, you can unlock a few more missions if you find two gold statues located in Liberty City. You'll need to sync your DS to Rockstar's Social Club website to unlock this feature. This game also features a multiplayer mode where you can take on other players in free for all, team based matches and races throughout the city. The only catch is you need to know other people that have this game and exchange friend codes.

If there is one thing that I can say is a flaw is that the multiplayer modes are local based only. You have to have people next to you to sync up, exchange friend codes and play. None of these modes can be played online and I feel Rockstar dropped the ball hard. I know many people would love to play online matches with other people but can't because this isn't possible. You can upload your stats via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection to the Social Club and if you register your friends, you can see their stats as well but that's as far as it goes.

GTA: CW is a fun and addictive game that pulls no punches. You have lots of things to do in this game so this will take you a long while to achieve the ""100% completed"" status. This game is rated M so parents, THIS IS NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS. This is for the players who are 17 years old and above. This game is violent, perverted and almost all of the characters in the game curse. Those who are 17 and over and are mature enough to see the fun and humor in this game will be the ones to get the best experience out of it.

Pros:
 + graphics are really beautiful
 + More variance in what the characters say, they don't just repeat the same thing over and over for seasons at a time
 + Lots more options for what to do with your day, what with battling, exploring, taming animals, creating things in your house.
 + Every item shows you exactly how much it sells for, how much energy it replenishes, and any special effects it may have
 + There is a lot more strategy involved, for example, if you play your cards right, you can have crops grow in any season (which is good, seeing as some crops take the whole year to mature!)

Cons:
 - The runey system sucks, and only gets worse as the game goes on, but its livable, given the other perks of the game
 - Sometimes I feel like it is not very clear what your purpose at any given time in the game is. I find myself running around for days not making any real progress in the story line.
 - The dialogue is awkward at times, and sometimes fairly offensive to women.

In between:
 * The combat aspects and upgrading of weapons can be somewhat confusing at the start for someone who comes strictly from the harvest moon genre of game playing, not the RPG.
 * because it is not a straight harvest moon game, there is less emphasis on farming, and you don't have the cute farm animals, but monsters instead.

I am not very far in the game, but it is very addicting. I think this is a great game for someone who loves harvest moon but was *secretly* getting a little tired of the monotony of doing the same thing day after day in the game.

Positives: The biggest difference is the improved defensive AI and how they play in both man and zone defense. You no longer need a fast quarterback to have success and with the new QB accuracy system guys like P. Manning and D. Brees are some of the best QBs in the game representing their real life success. Kicking field goals has been very easy in years past so the new kicking meter that makes it more difficult is definitely a huge improvement.

Negatives: The crowd could use a huge improvement. From seeing the same fans every few seats to clothes that don't match the temperature overall the crowds in the game need a lot of work. A new feature that hasn't worked out smoothly is the new play calling system, the idea and concept of this system is nice, however it still has errors at a noticeable rate. Some of the issues that have harmed the games integrity in years past have returned such as gang tackling causing odd animations, too many dropped interceptions, and QBs breaking tackles left and right.

-good story with awesome cut-screens
-realistic guns
-addictive
-high replay value
Cons:
-advertised as scary but it's not although the only game that every truly scared me was Dead Space
-you can't move and shoot at the same time which is frustrating
-combat can be slow and somewhat robotic especially when you are still getting accustomed to the controls
-there needs to be a dedicated trigger or bumper for swinging your knife
Overall this game was excellent and if possible I'd give it 4 1/2 stars. At first I was very frustrated RE5 because of the controls and because it wasn't what I expected. However, as I got used to things I began to really enjoy it. Towards the end of the game I was addicted and didn't want it to end. My advice is to give it some time and let yourself get used to the controls before you pass judgement. It's not really a FPS. It's more of an action-adventure game with some shooter elements.

Its a Third person shooting/flying/driving game with many weapons,including calling in air strikes with laser targeting and by sattelite also the ability to drive and fly just about anything incuding helicopters,tanks,military jeeps,civilian cars,etc.etc. The missions are open ended ,with the ability to hijack cars and military vehicles. You can also blow up just about anything you see ,including large buildings. The explosive effects are very nicely done and richly detalied,put C4 on a hood of a car then drive,ditch,detonate ,the car will sometimes explode into the air about 100 feet ,also when you blow up a building it implodes much like a real building does ,very realistic looking. The soundtrack is orchestra/operatic style kinda like  The Godfather. The plot is not very deep,dont expect (rpg) role playing game style game at all. But this game is very fun right out of the box. There's lots to explore and see. This game is like a summer action movie ,lite on the plot,heavy on the blow stuff up shoot the bad guys. Youre up against the North Koreans and your basicaly a bounty hunter/ mercenary ,and your hired to take out enemy leaders who are represented by a deck of cards,but you don't know where they are located so you have to work for any faction of your choosing including ""South Koreans,Russian Mob,CHINA,and Allied Nations or A.N."".You can work for all four Factions to do there dirty work. You'll be hired for specific contracts by each faction and they will pay you money and then usually give you a location of  (CARD) enemy after you complete there contract for them. Also based on which faction you work for you might either gain or lose status with a faction depending on whether you can do your contract in stealth or finish the task by not getting the opposing faction killed or civilians killed. You can  work all sides except for the ""North Koreans"" which of course  are always your enemy in this game. The map areas are huge with open-ended playability and each (ACE) card or (boss) has there own seperate map usually an island to visit after getting all other enemies represented by the suited deck. After getting  all the diamonds and clubs enemies a whole new map opens up and you then have the ability to travel between both north and south provinces. There's lots of bonus missions also.

Love:
*  Always been a huge fan of Nobuo Uematsu and Akira Toriyama. These dudes were my child hood. So much DBZ and Final Fantasy
*  The graphics are pretty slick for a last gen title. The  character design lends itself to a less photo realistic presentation.
*  Turn based battle system. Not a fan of newer Action RPGs.

Like:
*  Story is pretty basic, but serviceable.
*  Dragon Spirits are a neat game play element

Dislike:
*  Expressionless faces of the main characters. They would look fine in a manga, but make them look super creepy in a video game
*  A little too easy. No party wipes so far, and have only died a few times, but was able to revive easily enough.
*  The game is 3 DVDs long. Really shows the disadvantage of the media. Would love to have seen this game on PS3

Hate:
*  The game routinely will drop under 20 FPS during battle. This is unavoidable.
*  Battle animations get boring and I wish there was a way to skip them or at least speed them up

Overall I would recommend this game. If you have an XBOX 1, even more so since it is backwards compatible and the game runs at a stable 30 FPS. Truly a shame this wasn't released simultaneously on the PS3 - could have reduced the discs and possibly even beefed up the graphics since data storage would hardly be an issue anymore.",A Gem I Missed,1503100800,,,

The tutorials were very helpful to me starting the game. They were quick and easy to learn. If not for them, I would have been lost.

The objectives are fun and the goals are easy to reach, whether you are a newbie or an old pro of the series. The graphics in the game are mind blowing! You can most defiantly tell you are playing a next generation game on the PlayStation 4.

The weather plays a big part in the game. Roads get very wet and slick when it's dark and raining. You have to bring your ""A"" game when you are driving under those conditions.

The are two modes to play as. Cop or Racer mode. Both modes are fun but the cop mode was the most exciting and fun to play in my opinion. Being able to personalize your car to give it your own look and feel is a nice touch.

Things I didn't like about the game are as followed. The gas and brake are on awkward spots on the controller. You should be able to choose to use the joystick or the buttons to steer the car.

Everything about this game feels just like a streamlined FPS. If you're itching for some more modern warfare but only want to spend [...], Frontlines is a great choice.
Pros:
+The few new features Frontlines offer generally work pretty well. The game gives you a handful of robotic vehicles, including micro-helicopters, which can be lifesavers in some situations.
+The cut scenes can be skipped. The story tries to take itself as a serious commentary on the oil crisis but who cares? Let's just skip straight to the shooting.
+ It's just fun. It plays like the store brand of Call of Duty but there's no denying the simple joy of driving your military R/C car behind enemy lines and under a tank to blow it up.
+Diversity. Though it doesn't help the story to do so, the game constantly moves around, from the slums of Moscow to a desert oil field to a backwoods forest.

Cons:
-The whole ""frontline"" aspect is a cheap ploy to cover a pretty standard level design. The game boils down to go here, blow up this, secure this, move on.
-AI. Your enemies can score headshots from behind cover 300 yards away. Your fellow soldiers are idiots. I spent five minutes trapped in a room because one of my guys just stood in the doorway, firing blindly across the map.
-The sniper rifle sucks. I like to lean on sniper rifles in RPSs, but it doesn't work here. Frontline's sniper is horribly inaccurate and only a direct headshot will kill an enemy in one round.

Many people here have been concentrating on all the cons this game has, or just saying that it's awesome.  Here's what I have seen so far.  Also, this is going to be a long review.  Bear with me, but I hope that it is informative and not boring or useless.

*May contain spoilers, depending on how much you know about the game*

Pros:
1) The cities are huge and beautifully detailed.  Walking around looking and listening is very fun (at least for a while, I admit it does get a little old).  There are some interesting characters to interact with (I've started punching the beggar women and the drunks who have shoved me into the water at Acre's port too many times for me not to retaliate).  You can climb virtually any building, too, and near the end of the game, all areas are open to you.
2) The music is great.  Each city has its own signature song, but it isn't long and overly played.  The instruments and melodies used are also what you would expect for a game set in the Middle East, but there are also times when you will experience a full Latin chorus.  The song for Damascus reminded me of The Mummy, and Masyaf's signature song is just great.
3) Maybe it's just because I like horses, but riding through the Kingdom on my way to the quests was a lot of fun.  Altair is as good on a horse as he is on his feet.
4) Sidequests: There are hundreds of flags to find (100 in each of the following three cities) in Damascus, Jerusalem, and the Kingdom, as well as a significant amount in Acre and Masyaf (63 [?] for Acre and 20 for Masyaf).  And don't forget about those Templar Knights.  There are 60 to find; I've only managed to take care of 22 so far, and I'm at a high enough level where I feel confident to actually go searching for them.  They can be difficult enemies, too, especially in the beginning stages of the game.
5) The fighting.  Oh, the fight sequences are so much fun.  I've started provoking guards just to practice my moves.  It's so realistic, and I think the game gives the player so much control over Altair and what he does.  You have to be quick, too, in order to react, and you have to know which move to perform, as well as getting the right timing.  Mashing buttons isn't going to work with this game; in fact, it can get you killed.

Altair is an extremely good fighter.  He is skilled and proficient, as the mini cutscenes show when he performs a counter attack or combo kill.  These are fun and awe-inspiring to watch if you're a nerd like me...make sure to try out counters and combos with all weapons to see Altair's different moves.  (Also pay attention to the guards' faces and what they say when/after he performs them, too.)

His weapons are what you would expect for a 12th century fighter, too.  He has a sword; a short, curved blade he keeps on his back; five or ten throwing knives, depending on your level (EDIT: I was just upgraded to 15 knives); his fists; and, of course, that really awesome blade in place of his ring finger that is retractable and is used for stealth kills.  (FYI, the throwing knives are also good for stealth kills, and almost preferable, in my opinion.)  He doesn't have med packs that save his health, and he doesn't have unlimited ammo for the knives.  Adds a little difficulty to the game.

Along those same lines, the way the game handles ""death"" is innovative and interesting.  Desmond is a character who is Altair's descendant; he is experiencing Altair's story as a ""genetic memory"".  The sheer fact that Altair is his ancestor means that Altair could not have died during the time the game takes place (unless he had some kids beforehand).  So each hit Altair takes is seen as a deviation from the actual memory of what happened, and when the memory is too far deviated, the memory is lost and must begin again.  Pretty cool.
6) The freedom the player has.  You pretty much get to choose what order you want to complete assassinations in.  You decide if you want to use stealth and the roofs to sneak up on your target, or if you want to go in for a full-frontal assault.  If you want to go straight back to Masyaf after completing an assassination, the game gives you that option, but you can also say ""No"" and take a horse ride through the Kingdom instead.  If you want to go find some flags or Templars before completing a side-quest, knock yourself out.  The game doesn't force you to do anything.

Cons:
1) Repetitive.  This is something that I'm sure everyone who has played this game has noticed.  In each city, there are tall buildings called ""view points"" that Altair must climb, and from there he is able to pinpoint some necessary sidequests.  Saving civilians from guards is a lot of fun.  Not only does it give you a reason to fight some guards, but your reward is either a group of men who will literally restrain guards who chase you, or a group of scholars you can blend with.  You can also interrogate (follow someone into a secluded area, beat him for information, and then kill him), eavesdrop, and pickpocket letters and maps from people.  Assassination missions never change, either.  You have your target, you find him and kill him, and return to the bureau.  It is never changed with time of day, weather, or anything.  As much fun as it is to carry out these missions, they do get old after a while.
2) The guards.  Altair is supposed to be this crazy awesome skilled assassin.  He can climb up buildings, run easily over rooftops, dodge through big crowds...so it was really disappointing (and shocking) when I was chased for the first time and realized that the guards were keeping up with me and could catch up if I made even the smallest mistake.  Also, the AI of the guards can be obnoxious at times.  Even when they're in yellow mode (I believe this is called ""Suspicious""), they won't react if you climb a building right in front of them, even though they are supposed to be on the lookout for an assassin (especially true during the later missions where the assassination targets are well aware they are being hunted).  If they did react, it would limit the player's ability to do whatever he/she wants, but it takes away from the game a little bit.  Also, in the Kingdom the rival guards (basically any that aren't a part of the Brotherhood) are always on ""Alert"" which means they will attack if you show the smallest indiscretion.  This includes jogging on foot or trotting the horse.  So it gets really frustrating to have to walk very slowly by all those guards when I'm pretty sure they would already have noticed the guy in the white robe carrying weapons who is the only one they will ever encounter in that region riding a horse.  (Everyone else is on foot).
3) Altair's voice acting.  It lacks emotion at all times.  Plus, he speaks with an American accent.  Everyone else around him has an accent from a Middle Eastern region, or one from England and France (Acre) and some sort of Germanic language I've also noticed.  Someone told me this is because the machine Desmond uses to experience Altair's memories translates all languages into English...but I'm not sure if that even explains it.  If anyone has any theories or knows the actual answer, please comment on this review and tell me!
4) Some of the sidequests you have to do for informers can be ridiculously hard, especially when you have a time limit.  Stealth killing five soldiers in a crowded street in five minutes is almost unfeasible (and I thought I was getting good at the game).

Well, that's what I can come up with.  Sorry it was long, but I hope it was helpful.  Maybe I'm hyping the game because it's my first one for PS3, but I really enjoy it.  The repetition of the gameplay will undoubtedly turn many people off, but when you think about it, there's not a whole lot more for Altair to do.  He's an assassin.  He has jobs to do.  He's not going to take a vacation to an oasis somewhere and be sucked into missions there.  If you're a history lover, a gamer who likes combat better than storyline, or someone who has always wanted (secretly or not) to be a kicka$$ sword-wielding, death-dealing assassin, you will probably enjoy this game.  Luckily it's a greatest hit now and is a little cheaper than new PS3 releases, too.

4.0,True,"11 27, 2016",A37Q7OI175WGFB,B01EZAA2ZI,Christian Romero,"Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is the latest and most controversial Call of Duty game. Taking the franchise further into the future into space. This has lead to a huge backflash and many negative reviews from unverified purchasers that probably didn't play the game. I was also wary as I played the Beta and it was not good but the package as whole is pretty good. With gorgeous graphics and high framerates.

The Campaign was one of the best Call of Duty campaigns. You play as Nick Reyes a lieutenant turned capitan as the UNSA (earth) fleet is attacked by the SDF, a Rouge Martian faction led by Kit Harrington. With only two ships in the fleet you are called for duty to by time for Earth by delaying Jon Snow's invasion. While I wouldn't call the story groundbreaking it does tell a decent story and has a surprising amount of variety in missions. You can fight in space battles that isn't on rails you have full control of your jackal. The voice acting and cutscenes are fantastic with Brian Bloom playing your main character Nick Reyes. The shortcomings come from Kit Harrington, while his performance is in no way bad he does not really appear that much and SDF is just too mustache twirling bad as their evil dictators who separate from Earth to be evil dictators and their citizens love fascist and totalitarian government. Still for a call of duty game this still has a lot more depth than recent entries in the franchise. Plus Nathan Fillion's role as Ethan your robot sidekick is a classic. One of the strongest campaigns in years.

Multiplayer is pretty weak. To those who played the Beta it's pretty much the same thing with more balancing. The free flowing movement is getting really old and the whole time I was playing I felt I was playing poor man's Black Ops 3 which I liked. But Infinite Warfare I did not like as I wasn't surprised the market is back and it's still pay to win. The new specialists lack character. Maps are okay but the New Terminal is awful. If you play COD for just Multiplayer you might enjoy this one if you liked Advanced Warfare Black Ops 3. If you didn't Infinite Warfare is not the game for you. As I leveled up to 30 I stopped playing.

Zombies. In this iteration if zombies you play as 80s stereotypes of the jock, nerd, girl, and a cool guy. Stuck in an amusement it's fun a less complex than Black Ops 3 which is good. Paired with a couple of friends you're in for a good time.

Last the remastered of Modern Warfare which is one of the best remasters out there. Many remasters just upgrade the resolution and call it a day. In MW1 you get updated graphics new mechanics while staying true to the core game it's all good stuff and the Multiplayer is the same camper invested grenade spamming, ah nostalgia. The remastered is a reason many bought Infinite Warfare and also the reason for most of the negative reviews as many just want MW1. Business practices aside this is a great remaster and it's good to see Soap back.

In Conclusion Infinite Warfare has a surprisingly good campaign, equally as good zombies, a below average multiplayer and a great remastered Modern Warfare. On its own Infinite Warfare is more of a 3/5 but since the remastered is amazing I bumped it to 4/5.

Shift 2 is a bit more sim like than Grid, and after the patches are implemented works pretty well with a steering wheel.

Well modeled cars, excellent tracks and visual effects. Decent force feedback with a steering wheel. Not quite a full racing sim, but much more demanding than an arcade racer. The biggest downside to this game for me was the installation. It took over an hour to get it up and running properly. Be warned , this game requires that you have internet. It will not install if you do not. It also forces you to sign up for an account with Electronic Arts online gaming store, even if you just want to play offline. I hate this kind of forced DRM, which is making me far less likely to buy PC versions of games in the future, and instead get the PS3 or Xbox 360 version.

All in all for the next to nothing price I paid for this game it is still one of my best game buys.  Best of all this game gives out PS3 trophies for most of the game which is pretty easy.

I have played so many PS3 FPS and other shooter type video games they are almost a blurr in my memory then came Front Mission Evolved.  I absolutely LOVE Front Mission Evolved because; for the first time ever I am playing a video game where the Easy mode is just that Easy.  In Front Mission Evolved the easy mode is just hard enough to make you work for all the achievements \ trophies but not so mind numbingly hard that there is no hope of winning.  The graphics are pretty good all things considered.  Yes the explosions aren't photo-realistic but who cares. The voice acting is acceptable but not great.  The repeated lines during battle get old quick but these are minor little things unless you care about such things.

First last and always Front Mission Evolved is actually fun to play.  I died a couple of times playing the game but more from my own weakness as a gamer than any fault of the game.  I enjoyed Front Mission Evolved so much that when I got home from work I put it in the PS3 system thinking I'd play it for an hour.  I enjoyed myself so much I ended up playing it 6 hours solid.  It was close to midnight when I put the controller down.  The mech controls were perfect once I mastered them.  I enjoyed building out my own mech rather than taking the ready made mechs the game supplies.  When building my own Mech from the parts list I could equip the weapons and skills that best meshed with my playing style.

I have never once been able to get a platnium trophy in any video game because; lets face it I have cerebral palsy, autism and 12 other disabilities which means that try as I like I am not a great gamer.  However Front Mission Evolved is a game that while exciting and challenging is something I could win even on hard mode.  the game does not impose many unrealistic restrictions on the functioning of your mech weapons. There is some running around and killing things with guns on side missions so fighting inside my mech never gets stale.  I have played countless video games and never enjoyed one this much.

I must say first tier video games Bioshock, Bioshock 2, Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3, the First Borderlands not Borderlands 2 remain as special in my heart and they are better games BUT, Front Mission Evolved is the game I have always dreamt of playing.  Front Mission Evolved is perfectly balanced between weapons, skills and difficulty which makes it a perfect recipe for fun.  Even the checkpoints are correctly spaced.  The characters are sort of one deminsional but I still love them all.  If I could nominate a game of the year Front Mission Evolved  would be it for sure.  Sure if you are an intense gamer Front Mission Evolved is not meant for you.  Front Mission Evolved is a video game for someone who just wants to enjoy a video game that challenges you just enough to make you care.  After working a 10 hour day I don't want a video game that makes me work at winning, I just want to kill lots of things and cause lots of explosions and Front Mission Evolved feeds my needs without jerking my chain.

The funny thing is Front Mission Evolved is the one video game I would have GLADLY PAID $59.99 TO BUY and I got it for a mere $14.99 which is almost insulting.  I have some video game titles that are so hard I never got past the startup missions. The way too fast paced Far Cry 3 even on so called easy mode being my most recent video gaming failure.  I did not pay full price for Far Cry 3 so I don't feel ill used.  I would have paid $59.99 for Front Mission Evolved and left the transaction happy as a lark.  This is the most positive review I have ever given ANY video game and it deserves it!

If you are on a quest for PS3 trophies Front Mission Evolved is your game.  Front Mission Evolved has about 10 to 15 trophies that are easy to win as part of campaign game play.  A few more require group play. If you wanted to introduce a person to video games Front Mission Evolved might be a good game to buy if they have close to normal reflexes and sight. The music was repetitive but ok.

CONS...

The game requires you have certain MECH build-outs to win the final two battles.  Once you figure out the two special builds the game wants you to use in winning in the next to the final battle winning the game is easy as pie.  The final BOSS while intimidating to look at is actually a wash rinse repeat boss.  You just find a winning strategy and stick with it until the old boss gives up the ghost and you win.

The video graphics quality was about the best if we were still using PS2 systems. Knowing the potential power of PS3 graphics used correctly Front Mission Evolved game graphics are pretty lame.

The most annoying aspect of the game is how it takes the opportunity of free choice in Wanzer Build-out away from the gamer.  Front Mission Evolved  forces the gamer to use prescribed legs, weapons and other elements at times.  There is a special power called EDGE the game gives you then takes away at key points in the story. Front Mission Evolved lists that you have freedom to create your own mech and to a very limited degree its true.  Problem is your freedom to create your own custom mech is severely limited in truth.  I would not care if the MECH build supplied by the game was any good.  Unfortunately the MECH's forced on the gamer by Front Mission Evolved stories are always inferior powered down garbage that make playing the game a boring repetitive slugfest.

FINALLY

I still very much enjoyed Front Mission Evolved and I would still have paid $59.00 when it was released.  I beat Front Mission Evolved but the game is so badly designed winning in Front Mission Evolved is not a very satisfying experience.  I have replayed Front Mission Evolved many times now and still love it but the game is not without is major faults. Front Mission Evolved is no first tier game like Bioshock and it is VERY SHORT. For $15.00 new Front Mission Evolved is priced just almost right but $7.95 is its true value.","FINALLY A VIDEO GAME I LIKE!

4.0,False,"08 19, 2016",A240MZ2LJZGCAF,B01GW3GM7I,Home Theater Enthusiast,"I'll start with the good first: this console is very small, even smaller than the PS4 in a side by side comparison (about 1cm wider from side to side, but about 3.5 inches shorter front to back). It's extremely well built - gone are the creaky lightweight plastics and hollow feel of the original Xbox One, now replaced with thick, durable white plastic and a solid heavy feel for its size. The system looks expensive and high class. The upscaler is also really good - even backwards compatible Xbox 360 games (which run 720p natively) look absolutely great and crisp.

This Xbox requires your TV to be at least 60hz to select it's 4K option (due to some games running at 60 frames per second) and to enjoy HDR your TV will need to have HDR10 built in. So even if you have a 30hz 4K TV with Dolby Vision HDR, you might not be able to benefit at all. Keep this in mind.

We are 3 years into this console generation now, and it seems the PS4 is becoming the system of choice for most. However, I can say owning both that this white Xbox One S is nicer than the PS4 in its current form, both in terms of design, build quality and features (but a new 4K PlayStation is also right around the corner that will compete with this Xbox).

Needlessly to say, the game is fun and addictive (but still very creepy). It has a better shooter action and more challenging opponents than the original. If you liked Bioshock 1, you will not be disappointed. Although the play action of this game surpasses the Bioshock 1, the storyline wasn't as enthralling. And that's too bad since lack of captivating story makes this game just an another great shooter game. The philosophies of the characters, however, are deeper. This game makes you think of your own consciousness and what it means to be alive and choose.  Just like the original, you must make several moral decision that determines the outcome of the game.

Here are the significant differences between Bioshock 1 and 2:

1)You get to use both plasmids and weapons at the same time (not quite simultaneously)
2)The weapons are far more powerful than in Bioshock 1.
3)You are not as invincible as Big Daddy as you were in Bioshock 1.
4)You only get to store maximum of 6 First Aids and Eve Hypos.

4.0,True,"10 24, 2011",AWZXZL8P7UYON,B000UU5T7E,Kristin,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this game or not because I was concerned it was a first person shooter which I can't play (they make me feel sick).  I was really excited though that while it ""can"" be an FPS, it can also be played as a 3rd person shooter.  I had no problems at all, I really loved that you can create and customize your own character.  I prefer to play as a character I create rather than some predetermined character which is usually a generic looking white guy.

Anyway, I was really pleasantly surprised by this game.  I took a risk on it, unsure of whether or not I would like it but I really did.  Theres good and bad though, so here's my thoughts, first the bad:

1. The main quest is pretty short I think and you can knock it out quick, but you don't want to because one of the drawbacks of the game is that once its done, the game is done.  There's no freeplay after that last main quest mission.  I would have liked to have been able to go do more exploration or quests after the final main one or even to talk to people afterwards to find out their thoughts at that point.

2. There's a real lack in different bad things to kill, I count roughly a dozen or so different creatures and that's about it and you see most of the different creatures pretty early on in the game, so there's really not a lot of surprises.  Further, I found I could kill pretty much anything I ran up against fairly early in the game, so the stuff didn't really get more challenging.

3. I think there's a disconnect between levels and experience.  Either theres not enough levels or you get thru them too quickly.  I found myself maxed out at level 20 maybe 1/3 of the way thru the game.  That meant that I didn't see any motivation or benefit really to continuing to do certain activities as there was no experience.

4. There's a real limit to how much cool stuff there is in the game.  Again you see the same stuff over and over and there's not a lot of rare items, nor do the items get better as you progress.  That would have made more sense to me, better weapons and armor as you progress and encounter harder and harder foes.  Also, because of this, I found myself with lots of lots of caps (in game money) with nothing worthwhile to spend it on really, this took away motivation to bother to gather things because I didn't need the money anyway.

5. I get that there's only so much they can do, but still, every house seems to have the same internal layout, the tunnels all look the same inside, etc, just the configurations change.  Its not a big problem, but its consistent with weapons, armor and creatures in terms of a lack of real diversification.

6. There's a lack of diversification of faces, maybe a dozen or two and so you tend to see the same faces over and over, especially on the raiders.

7. Shooting when you're not in VATS, especially on a PC is a little tricky, but not impossible.

8. I would have liked to have seen some romance options, but that's just me, a romantic at heart.

9. It ends kind of abruptly.  I would have expected the last mission to be a really tough battle royale kind of a ""the biggest test"" of the game if you will, but it wasn't.  That's consistent with the fact that nothing really gets any harder or more challenging throughout, it all kind of stays at the same level even as you get slightly better weapons or much better skills or attributes, really it just gets easier as you go so for me, the end was really easy and I wasn't expecting it to end when it did.

and the good:

1. I really enjoyed this game and felt sad when it ended, I think because it really does have a great story that draws you in and truly makes you feel connected.

2. The voice work is nice.  Liam Neeson plays the father.  Malcom McDowell as the President, both have amazing voices.

3. While more diversity of music and radio station choices would have been nice, I did enjoy listening to the music and news of Galaxy News Radio.  The old style music was a neat contrast against the wasteland.

4. The world is very big and the environment is beautiful and detailed.  I would have liked to have seen it be a fully usable/destructable world like in some other games, but walking around, especially at sunrise or sunset, this is a really cool looking place with lots to see, lots to explore.

5. Tons of little side quests ranging from small nothing things to bigger things, so plenty to do.

6. I liked the karma system and how people respond to you is based on that.  Its not something you set in a window like I'm going to have X karma and be evil, its more based on your choices which I think is how it should be.

7. VATS makes shooting pretty easy and the slow motion of body parts flying everywhere when you hit something is a neat bonus.

So for whatever shortcomings the game has, I highly highly recommend it.  It plays out more as an RPG (role playing game) than a pure shooter.  You're not just shooting at stuff with no reason, this has a real story and you're a character in a world that you feel connected with.  There's a bunch of DLC add on content too but I didn't buy into that.  So if you're good with 3rd person shooter games (or 1st person) like GTA, Saints Row, Dragon Age, etc, you may very much like this one.",Great Game That I Highly Recommend!,1319414400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"05 27, 2010",A7P7ZBSC10APW,B0010AYJXI,ReelGuyTV,"Although a bit clique and at times repetitive, Alan Wake met my expectations and you are reading a review from a guy whose been eating up horror games ever since the very first Clock Tower (ever since the first Castlevania for that matter).

The story of the insomniac, temperamental horror writer whose stories are coming to life is nothing new (The Dark Half, In the Mouth of Madness). This is where Alan Wake fails to terrify the way it should, because you know what's turning the world upside down just by reading the back of the box. I would rather leave it to the imagination to guess why the world has gone insane.

Still, for what story this game tells, it tells it well. It's played out in intervals. At the start of every ""Episode"" you talk to people, get to know the town, play past events prior to Alan's arrival to Bright Falls. Then you're thrown deep into a dark environment, most of the time in the woods, but sometimes you'll find yourself in a specific area of the town and all you have to do is make it to someplace alive. Then the whole cycle starts over again with the next ""Episode."" This makes for a very linear game. I was hoping for a more sandbox style game where you can explore and find hidden objectives inside peoples houses, or in the shopping mall or the lumber mill. Instead you are tossed wherever the director wants you to be. But the gameplay was fast paced and the environments were suspenseful enough to keep me playing until I absolutely had to go sleep. At work or doing chores all I would think about is getting back into it. Why is that?

Because this game has got style. Alan Wake has got to be the most beautiful game I have ever seen, and hooked up to my home movie theater surround system, I felt the horrors were in the room with me. The gameplay itself is also very cinematic. The enemies are hordes of possessed townsfolk called ""The Taken"" and they like to ambush you as you follow the dark forest trails. Before you know it you're dodging axes, chainsaws, and sharp projectiles--each successful evasion played in slowmotion. You have to weaken them with your flashlight before you can shoot them, so you'll be doing quite a lot of evasive movements. You also have flares that you set off when you find yourself cornered and completely surrounded. Flash bang grenades for the real big guys. Once you exercise ""The Taken"" using all the illumination at your disposal (which sometimes include flare guns and spotlights) you blow them away with either a revolver or shotgun. The beam of your flashlight is your aim. So combat is very tactical. You have got to have a plan for any given scenario, using and sparing the weapons you find.

When being bombarded by enemies become tiresome, they step it up a notch with you being chased by a possessed bulldozer, streets and bridges blowing up as you try to cross, the sky raining cars and other heavy metal objects.

I personally feel that a true horror game is played mostly in dark, silent environments, but when Ozzy Osbourne starts to play in the background as you're taking off heads, that was awesome too. Like I said, this game has got STYLE.

Even the story segments (that you play and interact with as well) are very stylish and cinematic. Often times when you are walking around and Alan sees something like a prominent building across the lake on the side of a mountain, the screen prompts you to hold the L button so the camera will pan out and focus in on what he's looking at and he'll start to narrate his thoughts. Really neat how they did that.

Being an American horror game, I'm not surprised or disappointed that it didn't do for me what Silent Hell did for me when I first played that a decade ago. Yet Alan Wake feels new even though it borrows old subject matter (did I mention you had to use light to survive in Alone in The Dark as well?)

I'm a reader of Penny Arcade, and while I don't often use their recommendations to pick up games, the glowing review and concept of a physics-based game where you just threw stuff at blocks was enough to get me to put it in my GameFly queue. Broke it out at a party with friends, and I couldn't click the Keep It button fast enough.

When I try to explain Boom Blox to people, it just doesn't go well. You can't really explain how fun it is to topple half of a friend's castle with one throw, get thousands of points by blasting targets that can become tiny dots even on a 50"" TV, or getting just the right angle to send a block into the 10x multiplier. I always end up saying, ""You just have to play it."" It's a tribute to the game that I've had at least three people who had never played it before say they were going to immediately order a copy.

You actually don't just throw things: there are also grabber tools and a myriad of special blocks and tools you use to accomplish tasks from simply knocking point blocks to the ground to deconstructing elaborate structures by grabbing blocks one at a time without letting baby cows fall to the ground. Trust me, it makes sense once you play. There are several types of play, so you won't get bored with just one.

Single-player can get repetitive unless you're a compulsive who just has to finish everything (like me). Multiplayer is what makes the game really come alive: both the gamesmanship (and even anger) that comes out during competitive play and one of the most basely satisfying co-op experiences out there. The higher levels are genuinely challenging without being terribly frustrating. The three-tier scoring helps out a lot: gold is for people who just have to have all gold and silver and bronze are for those who just want to play through the game for fun.

The single player is the only reason the overall game gets four stars; I couldn't, in good conscience, give the ""fun factor"" of the game anything less than a five.

I loved this game but I did have a few minor issues with it. At first I bought the game just because it looked very intriguing I was beyond astounded on the graphics on the cover I thought ""Wow this game will probably suck with the graphics at an all high"" I started playing and noticed how I am such an enormous fan of puzzle strategy games! This game I played it for 2 days straight and beat it finished it. I hated the ending of the game, it was sort of a cliff hanger for me and I can't wait for the sequel.

Now I won't suggest this game to people who are very impatient or people who don't like a decent challenge. This game irritated me a few times for the puzzles can be very difficult to understand if you don't have an ounce of sophistication in yourself. Some people decided to use things like a walk-through [Which I will honestly say I did a few times but very little] but if you like to be challenged [and I do mean challenged some parts of this game can be very hard] then this is definitely the game for you.

This game was a bit short for me. This is one of the main things I would like to complain about. This game had a magnificent plot and the graphics stunned me. It can get a bit boring and cliche at times but overall it was good. If it was a bit longer I'd be magnificently jubilant, And overall completely satisfied.

Now for the reason I was disappointed, I didn't even bother to read the back or anything before buying it for that manner, because I thought I was going to play as the oh so magnificent D r a c u l a. This was not the case. You play as Dr. Abraham Van Helsing it was an alright journey with him but his voice irritated me to the point where I thought I would rip out my hair. His voice sounds stale to me but it isn't much of a bother after about an hour.

This game you have to think with but it's worth the money. I got this game at wall-mart expecting something incredibly stupid and got out of it a world where Dracula was the worlds worst nightmare and where it was Van Helsing's duty to stop the Vampire.

If you didn't like this game try the sequel, you get to play as Dracula next<3;

If you just need some extra controllers for friends/family to play with, or you are very casual with your gaming, this is a good buy. But if you are a hardcore gamer or play shooters or anything requiring precise aim, keep reading.

I tested this on my Xbox 360 as well as on my Windows 7/8 PCs. Windows drivers installed automatically and easily for this controller, no special installs were required, which is a huge plus as I hate bloatware. I played a couple PC games and even mapped all the controls on my N64 emulator. Everything worked great; all buttons and analog sticks were easy to map and functioned well.

Then I plugged it into my 360 and loaded Halo 4. Again, everything worked perfectly, but as FPS games require very precise aiming with the right stick, I could not play more than five minutes with this controller. General use of the sticks present no problem, such as character movement or menu selection. But every millimeter of movement counts when aiming a weapon in-game, and the sticks are unpredictable and frustrating to use in this situation. You could turn this into a positive by handing the controller to your skilled friend when they come over to play Halo with you, and watch/laugh as they struggle to keep the reticle on your head. But other than that, don't plan on this being usable for FPS games.

The triggers have a little bit different feel compared to OEM 360 controllers, but still work well and have a full analog range. The general quality of the controller is also pretty good, but noticeably below the Microsoft branded controller quality. This is why I believe this is a great buy, but only for the sake of its very low price. If price isn't a factor, the official controller will fare much better.

Amazing game- certainly worthy of being a title in the Fire Emblem franchise. There's tons of variety to the gameplay between the three different branches, lots of DLC that, while you don't need is great to have, and a wonderful cast of characters that almost feels like it's too much, at times.

What I love:
The characters are all written quite well- I'm especially fond of the group from Conquest. The writing is clever, and has made me laugh out loud on a few occasions. They really make you feel the consequences of your choice between Nohr and Hoshido (Conquest and Birthright), but it won't feel like a complete experience until you play Revelation. The battles are all good, there's tons of classes and items to choose from, and the ""My Castle"" addition is a welcome one that gives an added feeling of personalization and accomplishment.

What I don't:
There are just too many characters. Like, way too many sometimes. They're all neat enough and interesting, but it's really easy to feel overwhelmed when you're playing Revelation. Since I want to have all the characters and have each of them at least in their second class, this takes a lot of time and makes the DLC essentially necessary. Just one or two of the maps (for Gold and EXP) are highly recommended, if not necessary for the full experience.

The Cringe:
There are some very... strange aspects of this game that were changed from the original Japanese version during localization. While the human petting minigame is no longer there, the remnants of it are very cringe-worthy and make me hesitate to use parts of the game when around others. This goes double for when the player character marries, and suddenly some anime person is making smoochy faces at you.

Overall:
Great game. I don't think I like it as much as Fire Emblem: Awakening, but it's a very worthy title all the same, and I fully recommend buying it. Get the special edition if you can (unlikely), otherwise try Birthright for beginners and Conquest for more experienced players. Then download the other two for a discount, and enjoy!

DISCLAIMER: The way the sale of this special edition was awful. Certain retailers put no caps on how many individuals could buy, so scalping was (and still is) absolutely out of control.

The campaign is thrilling, intriguing, gory, and complex. It is a thriller/horror game, so I would only advise playing it if you enjoy screamers and jump-out-at-you thrills. Creatures and monsters will be jumping at you left and right. Just when you think you've killed them all, another will attack you from behind. Thanksfully, there are many save points and checkpoints so you won't have to repeat too much when you die. I said ""when"" because you WILL die! :)

Puzzles are also a big part of the game. If you don't enjoy simple puzzles (stuff like you'd find in Zelda dungeons), then this is not the horror game for you, because there are lots of mini-puzzles and minigames, such as putting key things and rearranging things so that they will fit. I found the puzzle element getting a bit tiring near the end and some parts stumped me to the point where I had to look at a walkthrough, but the puzzles honestly aren't too difficult. One thing I really liked about the game was the breadcrumb feature, which would point the direction you should be heading if you got lost, which I did often. This feature has been criticized for discouraging exploration, but I say if you don't like it, then don't use it.

The graphics are beautiful. If playing on a PC, I would recommend playing on a PC that can run the game on high settings because visuals are a big part of the game.

My one problem with this game, however, is that most of the levels seem repetitive. After 3-4 hours into the game, the layout of the levels seem repetitive and recycled. This makes sense, of course, because the game takes place on the same ship, but a little more variety or novelty in level design would have been nice. A chapters in the game do stand out, but most of the time, you'll find yourself trudging through the same, dark alley. That being said, there is also not much variety in enemies. I could count on my hands different types of enemies in the games. While this doesn't take away from the difficulty in the game, you won't find yourself discovering new enemies through the story.

One last thing I would like to note is the fact that the ""normal"" difficulty is harder than you might think. Most games I play are on the ""normal"" difficulty setting and I can beat them without too much trouble. Playing Dead space on normal difficulty, however, I found myself desperate for money and sparing ammunition wherever I could. So if you find normal difficulty to be challenging on most other games that you play, I would recommend the ""easy"" setting when playing Dead Space.

Overall, for under $20, I would recommend this game. The horror element had me jumping out of my seat and the visual elements had me amazed.

4.0,True,"05 4, 2010",A2T94J69VERDRP,B002TDIEEK,Luffy,"I have the original SFIV and had my doubts of whether I want to get this or not and finally decided to. Here's what I found and hopefully it helps people like me who own the original decide whether to get this or not.

Online Experience: First thing I noticed was a lot of players with good connections. For either green or yellow, play is smooth.  There is some lag but from my experience it's 1 out of 20.  I have not tried playing with red connection.

New Characters: Almost all of them does not feel like typical SF, moves are not the common SF moves and are definitely fun to try out.  It makes the game really feel new.

New Ultras: For the ones I tried like Dhalsim and Chun-li, it adds a different twist to how you play opening up other opportunities to combo and damage your opponents. Too bad you are only able to choose one :). Again a big factor which makes the game feel new.

Challenge mode: This feature is where you can learn combos. The main difference from SFIV is here it allows you to choose which combo challenge to take, every challenge is already unlocked. In the first one you cannot proceed unless you succeed with the latest unlocked challenge. This is definitely a great change, because for some of us who are not really skilled enough to pull off all the combos, we can skip to the ones we can do and master those. I find some more advanced combos easier to pull off than other basic ones because of the timing requirements.

Offline Experience: Still about the same as the original, AI has been updated for most of the characters but still the same issues where they violate rules of how to execute moves like not charging etc. The CPU is programmed to execute some kind of counter to your move and has very little offensive capability by themselves.  Try using Deejay and slide against Ryu, guaranteed uppercut to the face :).  For this I took out 1 star because although most of this game's value is online, there are some people who do enjoy playing by themselves and I think capcom can do a better job at this.  There are so many good players out there which can be used as a template for the AI.  Basically playing AI is like a puzzle, figure out a technique and stick to it and you are done, it does not change much each play through.

Balance:  There are noticeable tweaks here and there but I don't really think it's for balance.  Characters are still categorized by tier.  Chances are your favorite character remained in the same tier even after the tweaks.  As for the new characters, it's much harder for me to guage the balance because I am still not familiar with their moves.

4.0,False,"11 16, 2008",ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B000ZK9QD2,Poisoned Blade,"I rented Gears 2 and played through the Single-Player Campaign in 3 days.  It is a true sequel to the original game, so the story is a continuation and the gameplay doesn't really offer anything drastically new.  With that said, Gears of War 2 slightly improves on all of the Campaign aspects of the original Gears of War.

The strength of Gears 2 is definitely the Campaign, whether you play single player or with a friend.  Most of the levels are truly epic and now there's moving and destructible cover.  The weaknesses are the multi-player.  There's some lag and starting a game could take a while.  Also, the chainsaw and mortars (explode in the air and release a cluster bomb) seem cheap ways to kill or be killed.

The Story 7/10
There is one, it's ok, and doesn't bog down the gameplay.  There are a few dramatic scenes in the story, but not enough build up to make them truly memorable.  However, the action never slows and the story does a good job at setting up the levels in the campaign.  The story is an improvement over the first Gears, although that's not saying much.

Gameplay 8/10
The gameplay is very similar to the original Gears.  Play single player or co-op.  Duck, Flank, Shoot.  But now there are more enemies and more weapons.  The gun battles are really fun and the wide range of enemies keeps the action interesting.  Battle enemies with mortars, flame throwers, gatling guns, lancers, rifles, machine pistols, grenades, shotguns, sniper rifles... etc.  You can also take shields from enemies and plant them as portable cover and of course, you can grab a wounded enemy and use them as a meat shield.  There are also finishing moves like the beat down, curb stomp, and the chainsaw up the a...

There are a few enemies that change the battles strategies like tickers.  They're like jihad-watchdog-suicide-bombers.  You need to shoot them before they get close to you and explode.  They definitely get your attention in battles.

There are some vehicle levels where you get to mow down hundreds of enemies at a time with a tank.  This is pretty satisfying.

There are 4 difficulty levels for the campaign and the checkpoints are very generous.  Just about anyone can finish Gears and the harder levels offer a challenge for the hardcore gamers.

There's also a Horde Mode where you and some friends can battle wave after wave of enemies and accumulate a score.  Horde mode is pretty addicting because the gameplay mechanics are fun and the pacing of the battles are intense.

Levels 8/10
The first Chapter of Gears 2 showcases some of the best looking battles of all time.  You really get the feeling that you are in a war.  Reavers fly into the battles from above, buildings collapse around you, armies of enemies rush onto the battlefield like a gruesome tide of terror.  Gears 2 raises the bar as far as epic battles are concerned in the same way that Call of Duty 4 raised the bar on intensity.  The battles are are something that everyone should experience, even if you just want to rent the game.

However, when the game decides to move away from the duck, cover, shoot gameplay, the levels are pretty awful.  Whoever thought 'driving a tank with poor traction on cracking ice and insta-killing them if they fell through' was a fun idea, should be banished from the game industry.  The great levels outnumber the bad 7 to 1.

Art 9/10
Gears 2 looks amazing.  They've moved away from the grey enemies and grey backgrounds and added some color and some awe-inspiring views.  The characters, enemies, and effects all look great as well.  The presentation of Gears 2 is through the roof!

It's rated M for violence, gore, and language.  The Game is about 12 hours long and 10 of those hours are really good.  The Horde Mode and Online Versus Mode can add hundreds more hours of fun.

Avoid this game if you didn't like the first Gears, you don't like M Rated Games, you want great multiplayer, or you want vehicle combat like Halo.",New and Improved!  10% More Awesomeness,1226793600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The first game was okay but needed a bit more polishing this game I feel they polished it up a bit more and added new features and stuff. Unfortunately the plot kinda stinks. They start to make the guy you started to root for in the first game the bad guy which probably got quite a few people mad. They still have the fun things like being able to get into tanks and such from the first game here so that's fun to. But some of the storytelling is in comic book form. If I wanted to read a comic book of this game I would have went out to buy one. They have a few new vehicles you can drive but they are just different variations of tanks/helicopters. There is also more area to cover in this game it feels like with 3 islands. I would say its about the same as the first game. It has more polish then the first game but the plot is worse so it kinda evens out.

If they make a third game (which doesn't seem like they will because this one looks like it didn't sell well) they better really work hard on getting a good story together and keep it polished up otherwise it won't really be worth it.

Xenosaga episode I introduced a vast and promising universe full of interesting concepts and characters and the promise of an in depth and interesting story. The first installment introduced everything from Realian rights, to discrimination; you even knew that the Seraphim Sisters were a popular girl group, giving you a feel of the setting that the game was to take place in. Sadly the universe that was introduced in the first installment has been methodically chipped away so that by episode III it has become the size of a person and that person is Shion Uzuki. A fair ninety percent of the game is focused on her and her far reaching effects on the world. The atmosphere of Xenosaga episode III was, I believe, supposed to have an apocalyptic feel, however, the impact of that was lost on me from seeing something that allegedly involves the fate of the entire universe from one person's point of view. There is too much going on in XSE III to be focused on one person for so long. Not only that it seems like an incredible waste to introduce so many interesting characters in episodes I and II only to shove them aside to focus on one and then to not only neglect characters that could have added an extra layer to the story but to introduce new characters who contribute nothing to the plot. I spent a majority of the game waiting for something plot wise to suck me in before finally admitting to myself that it wasn't going to happen. ""Plot twists"", revelations, and explanations are given in such a rapid succession that instead of being amazed at what I had found out I usually ended up rolling my eyes and muttering so what or asking do you really expect me to believe that?

It's a solid game even though the direction and execution of the story makes it fall short of what I expected it to be. My disappointment with it however still doesn't allow me to label it a bad game because it isn't which is why I have given it four stars. The battle system was fun and engaging to the point where I actually looked forward to getting into battles and the graphics were gorgeous. I have to admit that this is one of the most visually pleasing games that I've played all year. The dialogue however, is a mixed bag between thought provoking and unintentionally hilarious. While I was underwhelmed with the story it's still interesting enough so that if you're a fan of story driven rpgs that this is definitely something that you would want to look into, if you aren't already an initiate into the series.

Xenosaga does have a rather engaging storyline, but it didn't live up to the expectations that I formed upon playing episode I and even II. Perhaps my expectations were too high or perhaps I was led to expect something that never developed. Personally I felt as if it wasn't worth playing three games to get such an ambiguous and unsatisfying ending. I've played three games and not once have I ever gotten anything that even remotely felt like completion at the end of any of them.  This doesn't however mean that I hate the game, but I wasn't impressed with it either.  The writing, pacing, and direction felt too uneven, as if it was the result of a round robin with multiple people changing and adding to what had already been stated than as if it was a consistent campaign. Before any die hard fans get up in arms and decide that I didn't understand the story, let me assure them that I did. I just didn't care for the direction that was taken when there were so many other directions that the game could have gone in and left a more fitting conclusion than what was presented.",An Engaging Disappointment,1164844800,12,,

While Nintendo's Mario Party 4 doesn't rely on any of the above, it does provide a digital alternative to raging hangovers and vague memories of the previous night's activities. Although it's the fourth title in the series, it's the first Mario Party game on the GameCube, and it packs a decent four-player punch.
Mario Party 4 goes a little above and beyond its previous incarnations, and thanks to some skillful development from Hudson Soft, eight of your favorite Nintendo characters are ready to do battle through over 50 nutty mini-games in order to win a juicy prize. Lending itself to a very simple gameplay premise, Mario Party 4 is best enjoyed with four human players -- the idea is to be guy that collects the most hidden stars and gold coins at the end of a party. Each party is played over a selectable number of turns (from between ten and 50 -- ten turns takes around 30 minutes to play) on one of five themed game boards.
Some familiar faces are on hand to meet and greet the party-players. Toad, Shy Guy, Koopa, Boo, and Goomba all offer a game board with themes such as the ""Seaside Soiree,"" the ""Haunted Bash,"" and the ""Jungle Jam."" There are eight Nintendo-friendly guys and gals to choose from at the player select screen: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Daisy, and Waluigi. There are essentially two main modes of play in Mario Party 4.
Party mode is where the most fun occurs and involves between one to four human players getting jiggy on any of the game boards. Story mode is the single-player component of the game and pits you against three randomly selected CPU-controlled guys. If you win the game, you'll be awarded a prize, and depending on which character you were playing as, it'll be different each time (e.g. Playing as Waluigi, I won Waluigi's Shelf, which is one of many unique pieces of furniture that can be found for his mini-apartment -- viewable in the prize room).
One new feature to the series is the mini-mega system -- which manifests itself in the form of two different mushroom-based items. These items can be taken before you roll the die at the beginning of turn. A mini-mushroom will shrink you down, allowing you to access other areas of the board, but it'll limit your maximum die roll to five instead of six. Being mini will allow you to tackle some special ""mini"" mini-games too.
Going the other route and taking a mega-mushroom, will in contrast increase the size of your guy, and it'll give you a combined roll of two dice, increasing your ability to travel further around the board. You'll also squish any players that you travel past, causing them to hemorrhage value gold coins. Being large also means you'll be immune to any event spaces on the board. The mini-mega system is cool in theory, but in actuality, it doesn't really add that much to the gameplay.
There are a ton of new items, events, traps, and bonuses that are scattered through the game -- such as the Genie Lamp which costs 30 coins to buy -- but it'll warp you straight to the current star on the board. All these factors throw more uncertainty into the mix, with the final game experience getting more and more random compared to the first three games in the series. Is this a bad thing? It depends on your point of view, but it can be pretty frustrating to be on top for most of the game and then have it all snatched away at the last minute. There are a few constants; these arrive at the very end of the game in the form of stars awarded to the player that collected the most coins, won the most mini-games, and triggered the most event features.
There's no doubt that Mario Party 4 sports classic multiplayer fun and all of the mini-games are a blast in their own right, but there's one hugely annoying factor -- the CPU controlled characters. In the single-player mode, you'll be forced to watch the CPU guys take their individual turns.
This happens at a mind-numbingly slow pace, and after a few games you'll be begging to have bamboo shoots inserted under your fingernails to alleviate the tedium. Essentially, the single-player game exists to let you win the prizes -- something that becomes very unimportant all too quickly.
Huge Mario gets ready to squash the others. Putting those issues aside, Mario Party 4 as an actual party game, works really well. Teamwork, smack talk, and cajoling come heavily into play, and it's certainly the best in the series to date. The GameCube provides the graphical grunt to take Mario Party 4 to the next level and all of the characters, boards, and mini-games display slick animation, special effects, and a sweet bouncy-cartoony look and feel. Controls for the most part are extremely simplistic, but this really only adds to the pick-up-and-play nature of the game as a whole. There's a myriad of nice Nintendo-tastic tunes, voices, and sound effects, which wrap the game up into a well-presented, good-looking game.
For those that enjoy Nintendo's rich characters and imagination, Mario Party 4 is a great game to have. With four-players in tow, it's a total blast, but for those that are looking for some solid, non-anger-inducing solo play, you'd do well to swerve away from this one for sure.
The Lowdown: More of the same great Mario Party multiplayer action.
Pros: It looks great; the mini-games are a hoot; really good fun with four players.
Cons: More features aren't necessarily a good thing; there's little fun when flying solo.

I was basically planning to give this game a 3-star rating through most of the game play, but it won me over towards the end and I think it deserves 4-stars. It did take me awhile to get interested in the game. Something about the story I don't think I found all that compelling, and I did play Resident Evil 5 right before starting on this game, so there was likely some ""hangover"" effect as I'm a big fan of the RE series (isn't everyone?!).

As I said, the story didn't really engage me much until the end. I chose to help the Little Sisters rather than harming them, and this ""savior"" role seemed to get me more interested in the story. I really enjoyed the last few stages of the game much more than the beginning or even mid points of the game. For awhile there during the middle of the game, after I had already gotten several plasmids to use, I started to tire of the game a bit because it was pretty easy to just use a plasmid, followed by the pistol or machine gun to take down nearly any enemy you meet (I favored the inferno, but the freezing blast worked well on the ""ghosts"" - but keep in mind that the freeze will not allow you to collect loot after you kill them). The Big Daddy's were really easy to defeat once I got the hang of it - just use the inferno followed by the electric shotgun buck or exploding buck. In fact I only died one time in the game, and that was very early on when I wasn't use to the game play. So I didn't make much use of the Vita Chambers, though I thought that was probably the coolest design in the game! I want a Vita Chamber in my apartment now! LOL

The game play was pretty fun, though like I said I did grow tired a bit of it about midway through the game. There are quite a number of plasmids and weapons you can use, and they all can be upgraded. In fact I think towards the beginning of the game I thought it was a bit of overkill until I started using many of them and found that I really only liked or used a few of them most of the time. The Inferno was my default, I would use the Frozen Blast if I was fighting ghosts, but that was only in one stage of the game that I recall, and I would use the Hypnotize Big Daddy from time to time to use him to kill other enemies before I killed him, and then use the Bee Swarm for fun sometimes (!) though it wasn't really that effective.

The graphics were good, but ""comic-bookish"" I thought. In other words I didn't perceive the environment to be realistic, more like a comic book design. But there certainly was a lot of detail. It had a real artistic flare to it. I also liked the tape recorders that you pick up, which fills in the story for you. Though mixing in some paper reports with the tape recorders probably would have been better. And a tip for you, use the subtitles option - for some reason the volume on the recordings is really low and sometimes the accents are difficult to understand. The game was much more enjoyable when I could read the subtitles and understand what was being said! The tape recorders were a nice idea, though the execution of it was not so good, since they were difficult to hear!

You've probably figured this out by now, but there are alternate endings to the game. I got the ""good ending"" as I rescued all the Little Sisters and earned the ""savior trophy"" but a friend of mine killed them and he got what he called ""the bad ending"" - I'm not sure what it was, but I think it is safe to say that you should not kill the Little Sisters, your enjoyment of the game will surely be enhanced.

4.0,False,"11 9, 2010",A180XX745S4DZY,B001TOMQVM,RPGee Wiz,"Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of racing games for the most part. Before this, the last time I played a racing game was Mario Kart 64. Now that we have that out of the way let me just say that for certain reasons I found myself playing this game for a long long time. I have to say that as gimmick racing titles go this one is loads of fun. I would rank it head and shoulders above even the newest Mario Kart title for the Wii. Its bizarre and random nature makes it a game that I find appealing.

Excite Bots is a game where you race along a series of tracks against other drivers, in an attempt to out trick them. That's right! Its not all about who is the fastest! Sure coming in first gives you a hardy point boost, but it all comes to nothing if your opponent has performed more impressive stunts! Perhaps what makes the game most unique is the fact that your car is some sort of animal or bug that can also turn into a bipedal robot on occasion. Why are you driving a grasshopper around? Why is it now standing up and running along in great clumsy strides? Why? Because its fun!

Graphics and Sound

The graphics and sound in Excite Bots are both solid. Nothing mind blowing, but at the same time it hardly needs to be. The cars all look pretty good, particularly if you are using component cables, which if you have the option you should! Music is some filthy sounding low down metal guitar. Its the kind of thing you might hear if you were stuck in an elevator or grocery store in the game Dynasty Warriors.

In the game there are dozens of cars which seem to be divided into bugs, and animals. You get to drive any one you choose, and each has its own set of statistics that go along with it. Unfortunately they don't seem to accurately sum up the cars abilities, as some cars with near identical stats will have wildly different performance... That and the fact that the stats don't matter at all once you get into higher difficulties, as even the slowest cars stat-wise will be leaving you in the dust...

Game play

The game play in this game is a blast and a half. Its full of ludicrous mini game like tricks you have to perform for points in each course. As the difficulty ramps up, you find the courses longer, and the tricks harder to get at some times. It can be frustrating in the highest ranks to get the amount of points you need, but if you play a track enough times you can really master it!

The cars themselves are often really silly, and fun. Each one also has a strange alternate costume that can be unlocked, in addition to a slew of different paint jobs. I guess since you are an animal/car/robot you can wear costumes... Most of the vehicles are not available at the start and must be unlocked, by gaining points.

Each track can afford the player a certain number of points that go towards unlocking things. Unfortunately playing single player gets you a pathetically small amount of points, and each unlockable, even for one measly paint job is punishingly expensive. Realistically you will not stick with the game long enough to unlock everything in it, and then there will be great periods of time between one unlock and another. The developers shouldn't have made the point costs so steep on this game. I know that unlockables draw a game's lifespan out, but this is somewhat absurd. Its the major detracting feature from the game in fact. The only semi effective way to get points is by playing multiplayer.

In multiplayer you can race against other drivers via Wifi, and when you do you can bet a certain number of points. If you place well you will come out on top. Unfortunately this still doesn't give you the kind of points you would need to unlock everything in a reasonable amount of time. Assuming you are awesome you may get a few thousand points, and the unlockables often cost many thousands of points for just one... It can be frustrating particularly to get the alternate costumes or some colors. Apart from that they even decided to make the pointless little icons that go next to your name while in multi-player unlockables too. Want the skull and cross bones or the bio hazard sign? Better quit your job... In fact testing games was my job and I still didn't have time to unlock the damn thing! That's playing the game for 8 hours a day every day for several months...
We had to rig up multi-player games, purposely losing, just to funnel points to one character so he could unlock everything... wow! You would have to really like the hell out of this game to sink enough time into it as an average player. Unfortunately I only liked the heck out of it...

The trick mini games on the tracks range from absurd to incredibly absurd, and are almost all lots of fun. Expect to be doing things like collecting butterflies throwing a pie at a clown face, bowling, making a ""Super Sandwich"" flipping around various poles, playing soccer, and many more. Each trick has a mini game like action associated which must be performed with the Wii remote. This game shows some of the best implementation of the motion controls of any Wii title to date in my opinion. its a shame its been such a passed over game. After only half an hour of game play you will probably start to feel the soreness in your shoulders. At first you will likely be too thrown off when you run over a square on the ground and suddenly a giant creepy clown face pops up and the command ""Pie Face!"" suddenly flashes on the screen. After awhile though, you will be well into the swing of things, and having your robot pie a clown, or slide along a railing collecting sandwich parts, will be second nature to you.

This game is tons of fun, and would be a great light party game for having friends over. Its suitable for all ages, and provides a decent level of challenge. It has a long life span even when not taking into account its unnatural lengthening qualities. I would choose this game over Mario Kart if its a choice.

Super portable...easy to hookup.  I did notice some sound being off key in the first Sonic game BUT I didn't notice any game lag or slowdown....I like the speed of the Sonic games much better than on the PS2 compilation disc.  Of course, if you have the original system, stick with that.  If you sold yours long ago (like I did) or never had one, this is a good way to go.  I had no problem with the controllers after I positioned the system at a higher level on the coffee table by just sitting it on some stacked books.  The range is NOT great on the wireless part but you CAN plug in a controller if you have one...or two.  I had just one cart, Road Rash and it plays very good on this tiny little system. The system itself is not much bigger than that original cart and is ultra light weight.  This is about convenience of not having tons of cartridges laying around but it sure does play them nicely if you want to use them.  Is it the same quality as the original system?  No.  Is it effective?  Yes. I mean, really...are you going to devote the hours to retro gaming you did when it first came out?? If you ARE then you might want to find a really clean original system.

4.0,True,"11 6, 2012",AFNG8O2DXRCUV,B0050SYX8W,JSC,"While our family plays Kinect games, I personally play action / role-playing games on PS3. I loved the PS3 exclusives like UnCharted, KillZone, Resistance, but also loved cross-platform games like COD series, Battlefield, and especially Mass Effect 2 and 3. I love the strong stories of Mass Effect balanced with battle actions, and this is where it leads me to try Halo 4.

I like the environment in Halo 4 very much - space and fantasy worlds. The details are on par with the very best. In the space ship, details including steams / smoke, electrical sparks are all very realistic. For the nature scenes, many of the tree, rock, and plant details are well articulated. Animation / frame rate is very smooth. I experienced no lag. The details on the faces of humans are among the best there is.  I do, however, feel many of the ship and platform structures and corridors are very similar. This leads me to believe it's the capacity limitation of the DVD.

The sound effect is clear and detailed, and the music score in some scenes are very well done. I frequently slow down to hear the music while enjoy the view!

I played the entire campaign mode to the end. Without playing Halo 1 to 3, I obviously don't have as much of the same sentimental attachment to the characters or their dialogs as those who played the series.  (But I do plan to go back and play the early titles!) Also I just finished the Mass Effect series, and are used to being non-linear. None of these justify knocking any stars off.  But the one area that didn't get the sentimental feeling that I got from Mass Effect, is the realistic feelings in the voices that matched the characters. Master Chief is more robotic which I understand. But for Katana, at the beginning her facial expression articulates a great deal (include frowning), but the vocal did not match the facial expressions. Again, my bar was raised after playing Mass Effect 2 and 3, which both female characters (e.g., Miranda) had great matching of facial expressions and feelings in the voice.

All in all, I like this kind of FPS game, shooting but more in fantasy/sci-fi rather than brutal battle as in COD. Its style fits me so I think that's what matters and it was worth paying the full price. And it's enough for me to go back to the beginning.

I have not tried multi-player mode yet.

Pros:

-Excellent Graphics. The PS3 is pushed to its limit. The game has a lot of crazy weather effects and some really nice physics.

-Sounds were great also. Voice actors did a great job,

-Story is pretty good.

-Combat is really fun and you get a lot of different weapons and abilities to choose from.

-Lots of action.

-The platforming elements that we love about Tomb Raider are there and done well.

-A few tricky puzzles

CONS:

-This game is rather violent. I have no problem with this type of thing but Laura pretty much gets tortured and beat down constantly in the beginning of the game. Overall the game is pretty violent, and has some gory scenes with dead bodies and skeletons everywhere. The death scenes are also pretty brutal. It is not good enough for her to just fall to the ground, she must be impaled by branches and other objects. Also, bad guys will stab and slit your neck when you die. I found some of this a little disturbing, but it wasn't that bad. If anything it makes it more realistic. I would just not have a young child play this game. There is also a fair amount of swearing. F Bombs and such. This is not your warm and fuzzy Tomb Raider so you have been warned.

-The game could have been a little bit longer. You collect a lot of weapons and abilities as you go through the game, but you really don't get a chance to use everything since you get upgrades late in the game.

-Stealth system needs a little more work. At times it seems as though Laura has trouble hiding behind objects , and sometimes when you feel you are hidden from view, you are still spotted.

-Needed more puzzles! Actually it needed more Tombs in general. They are in the game but they are optional. This game is more of a shooter/platformer along the lines of Uncharted and not the ridiculously complicated puzzles of the original games.",Great Game!,1396915200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Yes Prologue is a game with less content than previous GT games but still it has as much content as many other racing games.  I have always love the Gran Turismo series.  From it's humble beginning on the Playstation to it's trumped up GT4 on the PS2.  What has never lacked is vehicle selection.  Although in this game you are getting a rather limited 60 plus vehicles.  Compared to the previous GT4's 500 vehicles this seems rather minimal.  Although compared to some games that offer less than 50 vehicles, Prologue seems standard.

Gran Turismo: 5 Prologue begins like any Gran Turismo game.  Stunning and beautiful intro transitioning to the menu.  What is a first is the ability to play online and GTTV.  Both are welcome editions in my book.  The racing physics have improved in this version which make it much more challenging.  With previous iterations there were times when you could slam your call into a wall when coming into a curve without any consequence.  This game makes you pay for arcade racing.  What is an added bonus is the ability to use the all new Dual Shock 3 controller.  The DS3 makes racing that much more enjoyable.

Their are nearly two dozen makes of cars.  Although each dealer is only limited to two or three cars.  What is missing is the ability to tune your car.  That is probably the biggest drawback for me.  Now you do get the ability to do this after finishing all three licenses.  There are no skill tests to acquire these licenses.  Just completing a license to get to the next.  The first license is easy to complete but it does get more challenging after you finish the first license.

With this game you only get a paltry six tracks.  Although each track has different variations which does add more to the game.  This is one of the few games where I enjoy mastering the tracks.  So playing on the Suzaka or London track is a lot of fun for me.  The tracks are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen on any game.  Playing in London looks so real I almost think I am watching the real thing.  Watching the replays are so incredible that they are great ways to show off your PS3.

Lastly I want to talk about GT online.  The format is rather simple.  Pick a experience level based on how far you have progressed in the game.  Getting into the race is simple and only takes a few seconds to get into a race with eleven others.  You position in the race varies depending on nothing.  What is irritating is some of the people you may play against.  On more than one occasion I have been knocked off the road by others who seem to have only one intent.  This makes the racing not much fun as people tend to not want to play right.  I am hoping they will eventually allow for more user control on these races to help avoid these problems from becoming overwhelming.

All in all GT5 Prologue is really a fun game.  If you can look at this game as a challenge that will keep you playing for hours on end this should be a must buy.  If you are someone who has loved every Gran Turismo game then GT5 Prologue is for you.  Now if you are someone who thinks they will get bored by six tracks and sixty plus cars don't bother with this game.  For forty dollars it is well worth it to me.  A great racing game for the PS3.

I was partially right, but also had other large issues. One issue I found to be very annoying was the wireless adapter. I literally had to break one of the two prongs in order to put the adapter on.

A large concern is that for the newer models of the Xbox 360, you might not be able to use your clear DVD cover. I put the case together correctly, but due to the odd positioning of the unit I was unable to play DVDs at all. My DVD drive was not specified when following the tutorial. I had to take my console apart to put the OEM DVD housing back on the DVD drive and put the case back together again.

By far the largest, most annoying issue, was the incompatibility with a hard drive. If you put the grey panels back on the sides, you will not be able to use your HDD. Even after breaking a few more of the plastic prongs on the sides, the HDD still refused to be read. I then had to take the console apart again to look for a problem such as a plug that was pulled out. I plugged the HDD in while the case was off, and the HDD was read just fine. I put the case back together again and put the HDD back in and once again, it refused to be read. I had to totally remove the side panel in order for it to be read again. This works fine, except that my HDD is not secured.

Past these issues, the product looks great. The lights give off a nice luster and you can see everything in the case. I have never taken an Xbox 360 apart before and it was fairly easy to take apart. The only real issue I had were certain pieces not working, such as the clear DVD cover.

Would I buy this case again? Probably not. Was it worth the trouble this time? I think so.

Update: 19 May 2012

After a few months of using this case and buying other mods, I have discovered that there are ways to actually get the case to snap together correctly. I still can't use my HDD with the panels, but I was able to get the case apart and back together again much easier than the first time. I think the reason I had so much trouble with it is because I had never taken a 360 apart before then. I installed a Talismoon Whisper Fan and it fit perfectly with the case.

Anyone who doesn't like Animal Crossing had better leave now, because this game is practically the spitting image of it (save for the facts that it's simpler, and you're communicating with humanish sims instead of animals).  Here are the cons and pros; read them carefully before you decide on this purchase.

Cons:

1.  I can see where the game has been geared for little kids.  It's pretty basic and quite easy.  If you're looking for a challenge that will make you pull your hair out, then I don't see you enjoying this game.

2.  Can be repetitious.  You may find one minigame you're good at, and play it over and over when you need money.  That can be annoying.  Also, you're normally stuck talking to tourists and moody shop owners, and sometimes they're aggravating.

3.  The fishing system is flawed.  The instructions teach you the controls, but nothing else.  If you move the float, it plays music and I don't know why, or even how you use it; simply because it doesn't explain that part in the directions.  If you are lucky enough to get a fish interested, then you still probably won't catch one.  I tap on the float like mad trying to pull the fish up; but it usually takes too long, and I come up short.  Bottom line is, Animal Crossing's fishing system is much better developed; and, unfortunately, fishing is a small part of My Sims.

4.  I don't think the sim's speech was fully translated, but I'm not sure.  After you finish cheering up people with the seven expressions (laugh, converse, listen, get angry, cry, encourage, and comfort) they talk in a language you can't understand for a short while.  Maybe it's just muttering and meant to be cute; but if it's untranslated Japanese, it shows developers didn't work very hard on the game.  Personally, I like understanding everything people say, so this can be a bummer; even though it's cute to watch the sims converse.

5.  Some of the minigames don't function well, but that could just be my opinion.  I can't do anything with raquetball, because it seems that the controls are flawed there too; as you can't manipulate the ball like you should.

Pros:

1.  The game's design is pretty good.  It's pretty, and you can customize your character at the game's start.  It's not a huge selection, but you can buy more clothes and furniture.  Overall, it's just pretty; not exceptional, but pretty.

2.  Most of the mini games are entertaining.  I enjoy making leis and I make a lot of money off of them.  Paragliding is fun, Tic Tac Trump is fun, and even Racquetball is fun if you can withstand the control flaws.

3.  Most of the sims are lovable characters.  There's only one sim out of about twenty who I loathe.  In Animal Crossing, the neighbors are easier to hate than to love...

4.  It's addictive...  Maybe it's too simple, and the principles aren't completely in place; but the game manages to hold my attention for a while each time I play.  It's fun to charm the tourists if they take to you kindly.

5.  The storage systems are better.  In Animal Crossing, one of the things I despised was that there were so many clothes that looked good on me; but finding room for them was murder.  Same goes with furniture, stationary, wallpaper, carpeting, and even knicknacks you carry around with you all of the time.  In this game, you can buy as much stuff as you want, without crowding your house.  There's still a limit on how many pieces of furniture you can put in your room, but it's a pretty lenient limit.  You have so many pockets on your person, that even the biggest pack rats can travel comfortably.  If you run out of space on your person, there's even more room in you're chests!

I think that's all I have to say.  This game has many pleasant surprises that I haven't even touched on this review; but these are the main points in a nutshell.  If you want something that will entertain the younger, and relax the older, this game is for you.  The bottom line, however, is that this game is a lot like that Chinese cake that the chef eventually makes; either you will taste it and love it, or you will taste it and never want to see another videogame again.",Is My Sims for you?

Firstly, revolutionary Paris is gorgeous and very accurately represented. Sure, the map is like fifty times smaller than the actual city, but major landmarks are where they're supposed to be, and look exactly like what they're supposed to look like. I would know, I grew up right in the heart of Paris. The walls look old and cracked, the streets are filled with the hustle and bustle of hundreds of NPCs with almost no visible graphical slowdown, each district has enough to it to look distinctive, the lighting is absolutely phenomenal, and everything just look jaw-droppingly gorgeous.

The parkour is... well, it's alright. It does it's job. A few times, I've thrown myself into the black abyss or off a cathedral into absolutely nothing and died horribly. You still get caught on elements you didn't even know were there, like in every other Assassin's Creed game. Sometimes you just can't jump to the next hold for completely arbitrary reasons, just like every game before it. Overall, though, it works pretty well, and being able to tear through building interiors is great.

Combat is much improved over previous installments. Parrying and dodging work now, and you can get easily overrun by enemies if you don't plan ahead. I did, however, find that smoke grenades are an easy and incredibly efficient way to cheese the combat and turn almost every encounter to your advantage.

Side quests are very rinse and repeat. Some of the Paris stories are really fun, but most of them are just another variation on ""kill him"" or ""steal this"". The option to buy cafes and social clubs to generate more money is neat, and isn't intrusive on the game at all.

Story is whatever. It's not the best I've ever seen, though it's far from the worst. Average, I suppose, would be the qualifier. Arno is rather uninteresting except for the occasional quip or one liner, the Assassins are presented as a bunch of pricks, and the Templar are equally mean-spirited in their presentation. The only really stand out character, aside from the occasional historical fanservice, is Elise.

The game is overly ambitious and makes a lot of boasts, such as a claim that there are hundreds of thousands of weapons.  For the most part, the game succeeds and creates a satisfying and addictive experience best shared with friends.

PROS:
+++ Emphasis on co-op play
+++ Gorgeous cell-shaded graphics
+++ Tons of different weapons
+++ Missions and quests look to be modeled after World of Warcraft.  It is easy to tell what missions you have and what you have to do.
+++ Character customization options are abundant

CONS:
--- A lot of the weapons, about 95%, are generic forgettable junk.
--- Vehicle controls are hypersensitive at best or a sloppy mess at worse.
--- The story line is fairly weak
--- The enemy designs get really repetitive after a while

GAMEPLAY: At its core Borderlands is a standard FPS with lots of guns.  The emphasis on multi-player encourages up to 4 players to join forces and basically loot the place much in the way that Phantasy Star Online worked.  You can choose a brute, a hunter/sniper, siren/assassin, or soldier.  Each class has a specialty, but anyone can use any weapon.  Characters gain ability points as they pass levels and also improve their skill with individual weapon types by using that type of weapon.  Missions are nicely handled in a very World of Warcrafty sort of way.  While I'm not a fan of WoW personally, the system works.  Enemies in the game are randomly generated and sprouted from set spawn points.  After you have played the game for a while, you'll know WHERE you'll find enemies, but you may not know exactly what variation of enemy you'll find.  Ultimately, what drives the gameplay is the urge to build your character up and their quest for bigger and better loot.  Yes, it is level grinding, but the level of action.

PRESENTATION: Amazing, but it could use a few improvements.  On the good side, the game is stylish and slick with a Fallout/Mad Max feel neatly put together with some of the nicest cell-shaded graphics I've seen in a long time.  Menus work nicely and setting up a multi-player match with friends is a snap.  The game's HUD works nicely and gives you almost all of the information you need, but an onscreen mini-map feature is noticeably missing.  Instead you must open a menu system to access a map.  The other issue is the lack of variety of enemies, which fall into a few small groups.  There is fair amount of variation in the strength and abilities of individual enemies within those groups, but you'll mostly find yourself battling Skaggs (dog-like critters) and bandits.

GRAPHICS: Gorgeous.  The cell-shaded graphical design works nicely and the representation of the blasted wasteland is almost as good as Fallout 3.

CONTROLS: The controls are tight and responsive.  The auto-assist feature that helps keep enemies in your sights is subtle and doesn't hold your hand too much.  My only complaint about the game controls is focused on the vehicle controls, which are acceptable when you're in open spaces, but navigating any tight environment with obstacles is a profanity inducing chore.  My friends and I have accidentally Austin-Powered so many vehicles it stopped being funny and just angers us now.  The problem is that the camera position determines your driving direction and the left stick only handles your acceleration.  At higher speeds the controls work better and the vehicle responds more predictably, but navigating slowly and carefully degrades into an awkward experience at best.  Luckily, vehicular combat is only a small portion of the game.

AUDIO: The music in the game is good, although not particularly noteworthy.  The gun sounds are standard fair and the voice acting isn't bad.  The little quips and insults tossed out by the enemies get old after a while, but this is the case with most games where common enemies are allowed to speak.

VALUE: This game is big with tons of missions.  Many players will probably feel compelled to max out at least one character of each of the four classes.  I understand the level cap is 50, and I wouldn't be surprised if future downloadable packages raise that level cap by another 10 or 20 levels along with new zones, levels and missions.  I fully expect to get at least 30-50 hours of gameplay out of this title, quite possibly more.

Overall, this is a very strong game with only a few flaws.  I recommend Borderlands on any platform, but especially to any FPS fan that wants something slightly different from the standard Halo and Call of Duty fare that is so popular.  Fans of online RPG titles such as WoW and Phantasy Star Online may also enjoy this game.  The emphasis on multi-player co-op puts this game in good company with Halo: ODST and Left 4 Dead, so fans of those games should definitely consider this title.",Level grinding never felt so good.,1256169600,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Good
-Killing zombies is a very gratifying experience, they made combat uber-fun.
-The world is open, and give's you a lot of places to explore, which is a plus for me.
-The RPG elements in the game drive you to continue gutting and chopping off the limbs of zombies just to get that next perk.

The Bad
-While the story has been given points for being to lame for most, I find that a zombie game doesn't always need to have an amazing story, and Dead island delivers
enough stimulation to look past it.
-Giant zombies that knock you around repeatedly piss me off.

Over-all this is an amazing game in which I haven't completely beaten yet, but I look forward to hopping in the game once more and slay me another horde of rotten-angry zombies.

4.0,False,"01 4, 2005",A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B0002IQD1U,Ian,"You have to give EA credit.  They took a big risk in creating the first Lord of the rings RPG and making the playable charachters be people who are not in the movie.  A really big risk, but in my opinion, it did pay off.

The Third Age is an Role Playing Game, where you micro-manage your charachters and strategize battles (hance Final Fantasy).  It takes place in the same universe of the Lord of the rings game, but instead casts you as some ""other"" characther(s) (Hence ""Metal Gear solid 2"", where you played as Raiden instead of snake).  A Gondor soldier, an elf, a dwarf, a Rohan maiden, and a Rohan spearman.  The games story takes place parrallel to that of the movies (hence, ""Enter the Matrix"").  You begin as Gondor soldier Berethor, who has been sent by Denethor to find Boromir and discover what happened to him.  While a lot of people are understandably angry about not being able to play as the fellowhip, I was fascinated by the games story.  It's a lot deeper then you might think.  Berethor for example, starts out as a loyal Gondor soldier, but like Raiden from Metal Gear solid 2 he has a troubled past that genuinely suprised me when I learned more about it.

Unlike the previous two games from EA, battles in the Third Age are turn based, meaning that you plan out your strategies before attacking.  You can cast spells, attack your foes or use items to help you in battle.  The battles go fairly quickly and are easy to figure out.  When fighting, you get to use some pretty attacks, ranging from strikes that lower a foes armor, to awesome five hit attacks that can kill a troll in one hit.  You have to be careful when fighting enemies, as they can really kick your butt if you are not carefull.  I cannot begin to count the number of times all my party members were stunned and my foes took thier leasurely time beating the crud out of me (much to my fury of course).

Along the course of your journey, you'll run across famous heroes and villians from the trilogy.  You'll join forces with Gimli, Aragorn (who can kill a troll in one move), Gandalf (Grey and white), Eowyn, and a few others.  And you'll fight villians such as the awesomly powerful Witch King, the sniveling Grima Wormtounge, and the coolest fight in the game, taking on the Balrog with Gandalf (I actually squealed with joy the first time I played it).

The visuals of the Third Age are top notch.  The graphics are smooth and detailed, the enviornments are huge and replicate the film well (just wait until you see Gandalf fighting the Balrog).  I've heard some reviewers talk about ""Unplayable slowdown"".  I encountered almost no slow down whatsoever in my game, the only time being when I was fighting the Balrog (and even then it created a dramatic ""Slo-mo"" effect).

The audio is also excellent, using music from all three movies and fine voice acting.  Ian McKellen shines as Gandalf and Christopher Lee is excelent as Saruman (I heard that Andy Serkis recorded dialoge for the game, but he's nowhere to be found.  A forthcoming sequel perhaps?).  The new charachters feature good voice acting, although Berethor sounds younger then he looks.

The neatest feature of the game has got to be Evil mode, where you play as the bad guys in certain battles.  You get to control the Witch King, Gothmag, an Oliphaunt, the Nazgul, and yes, the awesome Balrog.  It's fun to play as the powerful villians from the trilogy, but sadly you are not allowed to pick from a list of battles that you want to play.  You have to play through each chapter, so if you want to play as the Balrog, you have to fight as Goblins and trolls twice before you can play as the Balrog.  Its a shame really, as I would love to just select ""Balrog battle"" instead of slugging through the other charachters.  And for some bizzaro reason, the good guys in Evil mode are often equipped with skills and equipment that you didint have when playing as them in the same chapter.  That got me ticked off at some moments.

Sadley, EA did falter a bit when creating the game.  My biggest complaint is that some normal enemies are just too powerful, such as weak archers that can fire arrows that prevent you from attacking with weapons.  And if I ever find the person who came up with the idea of reflective shield (A move where any attack whatsoever does the same damage to you that you deal to a foe), I will throw them to a pack of rabid starving wolves (or wargs), because that attack got me really PO.  It gets my blood boiling whenever my charachters are killed by lowly orcs because they are equipped with incredibly cheap and powerful attacks.  Very bad idea.

The Difficulty is also wildly inconsistant.  I never died in the first part of the game until I left Moria, but when I reached Rohan I was dying practically every three minutes from those damn Uruck-Hai (Who are also wildly overpowered).  The later part of Helms Deep was just a huge unbelievebly bad joke, where you're entire group is stunned and eliminated within a few turns.  It took me several replays just to get past that part, and I was strongly tempted to smash the disk out of frustration.  Not a good sign.

Also, why can only three good guys fight at once (with a few exceptions), when you're always facing up to four bad guys?  This causes the other three members of your party to lag so far behind in experience that they become pretty useless.

There is also no completion bonuses for winning the game.  You do get the ability to travel and see the areas you've already been to, but you have to save your game to do that, and some areas are never visitable after you go through them (such as Helms Deep before the battle).  That may be accurate, but I want to see them again dangit!  I severly wish there was an ability to go and fight the previous bosses with your highly powered charachters, but alas, thats not possible.  The Battle of the Black gates is also missing from the game (but you do get a unexpected boss fight in exchange).  The ending dosent wrap things up.  Like the third Matrix movie, it seemingly exists just to hint at an upcoming sequel.

But I don't want to paint a poor picture of this game.  When I was having fun and enjoying myself, the game was shinning brilliantly.  Being able to go through Middle Earth as never before was a thrill.  I'll never forget being able to explore Helms Deep in full, something not possible before.  Even though it takes some big liberties with the trilogies story, I enjoyed it greatly (seeing the Balrog for the first time is a true cinematic moment).

In the end, i'd recommend renting the game before you buy.  But if you like ""what if"" tales, the Lord of the Rings story, and good games in general (and you have a high patience level), then you'll probably like this game.",Enter the Matrix meets Metal gear solid 2 in Final Fantasy,1104796800,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Square Enix was kind enough to grace us with a remake and promised future remakes of the next two installments for the DS. Dragon Quest has held a very large fan base for decades now. In Japan that fanbase is even larger than in America. You could say Dragon Quest is the definitive JRPG, in that many games afterwards have copied elements of DQ gameplay. Dragon Quest has always remained simple and fun and I truly believe it is one of the reasons why the series has done so well.

  DQ4 is a very well done remake. It manages to keep the old feel and spirit of DQ4 for the NES and make it approachable for today's generation. There will always be some haters who hate the grinding and simplistic gameplay, but hey, you can't please everyone.

Graphics: The graphics might invoke more a combination of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and the Mana series rather than the first game which is fine and all since the game's quite colorful but then again, characters look more younger despite it being a sequel and there's on occasion some slowdown but when you have just as impressive FMV's as the remake of III, all those nitpicks kind of get thrown out the window.

Sound/Music: The first soundtrack without series mainstay Nobuo Uematsu, XII's soundtrack was epic and grandiose in its arrangements but rather forgettable in its melodies which made Uematsu's music such a pleasure since not only was it well composed, but it was hummable at the same time. Revanent Wings is pretty much the same soundtrack as XII's but sometimes it's more welcome here. No voice acting to speak of.

Gameplay: The battle system was refreshing in XII since gone were the random battles and its place was a MMORPG-inspired system with attacks requiring a certain amount of time before they're activated. The battle system in the DS game is similar but it's mission-based a la Tactics and characters roam the field fighting, healing and other such stuff. Aiding in your quest are espers, enemies that you ""summon"" into battle to help you fight the legions of baddies in a given level. Taking over an enemy's summon gate allows you to touch the gate and call even more espers which range from melee, ranged, and flying. It's a fun little system and while you can use different esper groups to battle different foes, it's best to just make everyone unleash on the enemy at once.

Which comes to one of my two nitpicks: the field can get crowded with not only your members (up to 9 main characters but 5 in a field) and a certain limit of espers not to mention the large amounts of baddies that can populate the field, it's hard to pick a certain member of your team to cure your fighters or to get a party member out of the way lest they get knocked out. The other is the way you level up: what made the original funner at levelling up was that you could go around the level and just stomp enemy after enemy without having to leave the screen, get the fanfare and your spoils etc but now that's back and it makes exp gaining slightly tedious since you have to keep replaying Melees to get your characters up in levels. Not to mention the game's difficulty is unbalanced at times with a fine cruising pace then all of a sudden the enemies seemed to level up faster than I do or I just got overwhelmed.

While the story is a bit more simplistic than XII's political-intrigue filled narrative and the gameplay is unbalanced, fans of the series would be good to give Revenant Wings a go.",Uneven but still a joy,1199318400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

My whole family (son 12, daughter 16, wife 46, and me 42) play it for hours on end. Other than the occasional rude animal that might call you ""stupid"", there is little to nothing objectionable. The game is open ended in that your character can pretty much do what you want, when you want. My wife enjoys fishing, I like fossil hunting, and my kids like bug hunting. The only real ""goal"" is to expand your house and collect furnishings. There are also a lot of date driven events, like contests (catching the biggest bugs, for example), fireworks, etc. We also enjoy being able to visit other towns via Wi-Fi, a very cool feature that works very well! The game is very fun and somewhat addicting.

For those that have played Animal Crossing on the DS, the Wii version really doesn't add that much different to the basic game. Sure, there are some new characters and most of the shops are now a bus ride away but the overall game of collecting, fishing, selling, and buying is the same as on the DS. Where we were very disappointed is in the lack of local multi-player support. With the DS version, all four of us could go to the same town at the same time. Since the Wii version is not fully compatible you can not use your DS characters interactively. Sure you can import you base character, but it's still single player. In some ways, the Wii version is a step backwards for multi-player fun.

UPDATE

Well I have been slogging through this game for the story but the fetch quests and the other parts stolen from bad MMO's are really breaking me down.  I want to like this game I really do I am a Bioware fan, but its just not that good.  The more time I spend in this game the more of it feels wasted.  All the filler from an MMO designed to waste your time to keep you subscribing and to let you level your character is in this game.  Most of it isn't any good, but once in awhile you find a gem.  It makes you want to play for those gems but there is just too much filler with too little substance.  I wouldn't recommend this game because its about 100 hours long but 80 of those are boring.  If you do buy it wait until its on sale big time.  It is kind of sad that such a huge potential of a game (dragon age origins) got watered down in DA2 then put with a bunch of BORING filler in DA3.  I would give this game after 65 hours of slogging through about a 6.5 maybe a 7.0 tops out of 10.

4.0,True,"03 22, 2012",AOGCLH5HLELD5,B003O6E986,Shawn Reinhart,"So the big question that has followed this game is, is it better than GT5?  The answer?  Well honestly, it all depends on what the player wants.  Both games are quite literally equal.  Where one falls short the other one picks up and vice versa.

  I've always been a Playstation junkie and a fan of the Gran Tourismo series.  So there may be some bias there, but I went into this game with an open mind.  First off I do have to say I've never liked the X-Box controller.  It's stupid and awkward and whoever designed it should be shot.  Although this is no fault to the game, in the game itself though I couldn't really find a good controller configuration.  I'm sorry but the proper controls for a sim racing game should be accel and decel=right joystick, steering=left joystick, up shift=R trigger, downshift=L trigger, and anything else on the d- pad or colored buttons.  I've played GT5 for years like this and it just works so so well and it's comfortable not awkward.  So basically for this game I kind of feel like I'm playing a Need For Speed game.

  And it's not just the controller config. either.  This game looks great!  It really does.  But where GT5 tracks looked a little bland, they actually looked a little more realistic.  I'm sorry but the real world is not just bursting with color and reflections.  I also feel like some of the cars just looked a little more structured and detailed in GT5.  Almost like some of the cars in Forza are off a little in dimensions.  And I noticed the Pagani Zonda R in GT5 shows the carbon fiber skin where as the one in Forza is just black.  This stuff is most likely not important to most people, but to those of you who are gear heads and auto junkies, you know what I'm talking about.  One thing that threw me off in the beginning was the first race in the Ferrari 458 Italia.  The brake assist is on and it's in arcade mode, which I was not aware of until you actually beat that race and go into the settings.  I'm glad you could put it to sim mode which makes it more like GT5, but I was seriously concerned that this was how the game was going to play.  It felt like the game was driving the car for you.  But I suppose for those of you that don't want a sim this game would be perfect for you.  So +1 to Forza for providing both modes for different people.

  As far as the music...both games may have a track or two that are good, but for the most part it's all annoying and distracting techno.  So I turned it off in both games.  Besides, I want to hear the engines anyway.  I do have to say that the cars do sound way more realistic in Forza than GT5.  So again +1 to Forza.  However I feel that the cars handle a little more realistically in GT5 and the full view of the interiors in GT5 is better than Forza.  SO +1 to GT5.  Also GT5 has smarter AI.  So...another +1 to GT5.

  Some opinions may vary on this, but I also feel the menus are clearer and easier to use in GT5.  Forza just has too many ins and outs with menus where as GT5 has everthing you need on the main home screen in career mode, and I feel it's easier to tweak you car too.  BUT, Forza does have more customization than GT5, and I know how much everyone loves customization.  So I have to say +1 to GT5 and Forza.

  As far as car selection GT5 has an enormous collection.  However only a portion of them are fully rendered premium cars.  I don't know about you, but I'd rather drive all the premium cars that have rendered interiors as opposed to the style of the previous GT games.  So when you narrow down the the cars like that I'd have to say that both games have about the same amount of worthwhile cars.  Now with GT5 there were some DLC packs and they were reasonably priced and you got some decent stuff.  Not a lot but some.  But with Forza there's a whole slew of cars that you actually have to spend real money on X-Box for.  I mean what the hell?  I just spent $60.00 on this game and now I have to keep spending more and more money on stupid X-Box credits?  Booo to that.  That's f-ing shady.  I suppose I will eventually break down and buy the cars I desperately want to drive in Forza, but I'm not happy at all with the way they handled it.  Oh and it takes FOREVER to download one car.  I'm talking about the free 2012 BMW M5.  So to both games and their car collections...um, no points awarded.

  So honestly both games are well done and by far the best on the market as far as racing sims go.  Both have pros and cons, both look and sound good, and both will keep you busy for months on end.  So which game is better?  That's for you to decide.",The BIG Question...,1332374400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone.

Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to ""buy"" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua. You'll dig the energy the music provides.

4.0,False,"07 26, 2007",A2290OIJTU42QP,B0009Z3MQK,Female Spy,"Animal Crossing: Wild World is a great game.  Like its precedent, it has some addicting qualities.  Unlike its precedent, there are things that add immensly to its quality; and things that can seriously rob it as well.  To articulate this better, I will do the Bad, Neutral, and Good, in that order like I normally do.  For long time fans of the original Gamecube Animal Crossing, or those who have to choose one or the other to buy or rent, I will constantly be doing comparisons between the two.

*Note: Please don't just read the bad.  I like to do the bad first so I can end on a good note with the good; but I don't want those who are interested, to be deterred without reading the whole story.

The Bad:

1.  There are NO old nintendo games to collect anymore.  So, if you are thinking about buying this game only to collect the old classics, don't buy it.  I believe this is bad because it can rob playability skills pretty well.  In the older Animal Crossing, if you got sick of paying off your overpriced mortgage and speaking to your neighbors, you could also play any old nintendo games you managed to collect.  This game just isn't the same case.

2.  The Able Sisters shop.  Mabel no longer allows you to save more than the eight patterns on your person.  This really disappointed me, because I love to design patterns.  So, regardless of being able to draw with the stylus, you can't do it often unless your willing to sacrifice everyone else's good designs or some of your old ones.  In the older Animal Crossing, you could save many more designs.

3.  While we are on the idea of designing, Wendall, the starving walrus artist, no longer gives you rare wallpapers when you feed him.  Now he gives you even MORE pattern designs.  I consider this a bad thing because of lack of a decent pattern saving feature.  The end result being you can get more patterns than you know what to do with.

4.  The mortgages are too high.  This too, can rob playability from the game.  So, you are stuck once again fishing and catching bugs endlessly.  You can get tired of it, and it's more difficult to make decent money with them this time around.  Also, because it takes so long paying off the morgage, your house can get crowded very easily after a while.

5.  Four players can live in one game, but there is a catch.  Everybody has to live in the same house.  Personally, I don't like this feature at all.  Although everybody does share the same mortgage, they also share the same stuff and rooms.  So, if you are hoping for a game to share with your siblings, or something of the like, make ABSOLUTELY sure they can be trusted with any valuable things you get in this game.  I believe more harm than good can come out of this feature; I preferred it when everyone had their own house in the older Animal Crossing.  Then you couldn't tamper with anyone else's items, and they couldn't tamper with yours.

6.  Don't buy this game if it's just to see Porter, the train monkey, again.  He isn't in this game, nor are there anymore trains.  I, myself, don't consider this a bad thing; but it goes in the bad section anyway for anyone who is a Porter fan.

7.  This game is not, whatsoever, able to link with the older Animal Crossing.  I don't believe there is such a thing as a device that connects Nintendo DS games to Gamecube games.  This is just a warning, even if you are a billionare with a full catalog in the original Animal Crossing, there isn't a way it will be helpful to this game.

8.  Your neighbors.  Unrealistically, one of them tries to move every two days (once you hit the maximum number of neighbors).  Usually, you can beg anyone out of moving; but this can be a pain to deal with.

9.  I hope you are not expecting to test your luck in Tom Nook's monthly lottery again.  The lottery is no more; in its place is... a slightly more complex system.  I will explain this a tad more in the good.  I'm not to upset by the loss of the lottery, but I put this here because I know there are those who will be.

10.  I don't think you can get Tom Nook's highest store upgrade without a foreign player (one from a different game card).  This is bad if you don't know anybody else with this game, as well as having no Wi-Fi connection.  I am this case.  However, I am not certain the biggest store upgrade is impossible to achieve without someone else's help.  Still, I don't have it as of yet.

11.  The beach.  While you can still collect seashells and the new bottle mail, there's not much else you can do there anymore.  There are no more islands, which also means no more Kapp'n singing in a boat.  Gulliver doesn't wash up there anymore either.  Said characters do make appearances in this game, but not at the beach.  Personally, I think no island, with no island mate, is a big minus in Animal Crossing: Wild World.

12.  How to meet Gulliver now.  Don't ask, just note that I haven't even met him yet.  His arrival in this game does seem to suit him, however, as he always was ""A basket short of a picnic, if you know what I mean""...

13.  No more saving gyroid.  For those who like every gyroid in general, this can be bad.  Instead, you have to save in your bed; or use the start feature (one I really don't trust for some reason).  To me it's not so bad, but Tom Nook has the nerve to call it another 'story'.  To me, it's not a story, unless you can stash your stuff in it; which you can't!

14.  Redd's store is the only place you can get paintings now, and I do not like it...  Redd, as old gamers will know, is a fox who just LOVES to cheat people who shop at his store...

15.  No more calendars.  Not that I can find, anyway.  If you want to receive an early warning a holiday IS coming, you will have to check the town's message board.  Even then, you will only get about a two to one day's notice.

The Neutral:

1.  Flowers now.  Remember in the old Animal Crossing, where you could just plant a flower and forget it?  The flowers would be beautiful, even for years, until you took the shovel and dug holes where they were; or run over them too many times.  Now it's very different.  If you want flowers, you have to buy a watering can and water them every single day.  Even then, some of them still wilt the next day.  Don't panic if a flower you love looks dead, though; just water it, and it will come back the next day.  On top of that, if you store the flowers in your closet, they will never die no matter how many days without water they go.  I put this in the neutral section, because whether it's good or not depends on how much you like to care for plants.  I don't really like taking care of them everyday, but it's normally worth the possible pay off (See the good section).  Oh, and please note, that you can pick up flowers like items this time.  You can sell flowers, but most of them are not worth very much.  If you pull out a wilted flower (gray or black), however, it will be disposed of like a weed.  Dandelion Puffs are also an exception to this rule, as they never have to be watered.

2.  Resetti, the Mole, is back.  Just like in the old Animal Crossing, he only shows up when you reset (turn off without saving).  I have yet to see if Resetti is as harmless here as he was in the old Animal Crossing.  I have only resetted the game twice; and so far, he seems harmless.

3.  There are no more Police Stations, but Copper and Booker still maintain slight importance in this game.  They act as guards to your city's gates.  Booker still runs the lost and found, but additionally, he can also sometimes tell you who the special guest in town is.  Copper, on the other hand, is only important if you want to go to a friend's game card.  He's also responsible for giving you your friend code if you wish to go Wi-Fi.  I consider this neutral, because the police station was a cute idea; but now they are guard dogs, which is also cute.  Whether this is good or bad, really depends on which one is the cuter idea.

4.  No more glitches.  Now, selling turnips will still never get you over a hundred bells (currency for newbies) if you time travel; but I don't think this is a glitch, as much as it is a mechanism to prevent cheaters.  I consider this neutral, because while the annoying bugs (such as the range of the tapedeck's, or whatever you have that plays music, music) are gone, many good glitches died as well.  If you don't like glitches period, than this is good for you.  Congratulations, you find enjoyment in doing things the hard way; this is the perfect game for you.  If you are open to good glitches, however, this is a bad thing.  Reason being, it means no more dopplegangler; as well as no more 'save and quitting' to get catalog orders instantly (which must have also been a glitch).  I think the catalog thing stinks, as you have to wait until the next time Pete delivers mail to get stuff that you order; which is very inconvenient.  If you are not a morning person (one who gets up at six in the morning), your only hope is to decide what you need from your catalog before five P.M., or wait until the next day.  I don't like this at all (I think DS games are too perfect...).

5.  Too many holidays.  Some of them are really poorly named too (La-Di-Da day anyone?).  I put this in the neutral section, because I'm sure many people like to party all of the time.  Tortimer doesn't seem to give gifts in very many of them either.  If you need earlier warnings about events, try to chat with your neighbors.  I received at least a five day, maybe even a week's, notice of Bluebear's birthday this way.

6.  Getting jobs and making deliveries is different.  Getting jobs just require speaking to your neighbors in general.  You can no longer ask for work specifically; but no worries, they usually give you jobs to do anyway.  This can be a pain if you just want to talk, rather than work or even compete.  How deliveries are now done can be bad.  They give you a wrapped package and a letter, both screaming to be opened, to give to somebody.  This is only really a problem if you can't control your curiosity, but this can be an annoying problem.  All I can say is packages are not worth the look, as you will learn what they are when the recipient gives them.  Letters... only occasionally.  It's more likely your neighbors will pay you with bells for these jobs, but you can get better pay catching a flock of mosquitoes...  Not really worth the pay, but for 'friendship' purposes (see the good).

The Good:

1.  How many ways can you say 'realistic'?  That's what this game is.  This game took greater advantage of its three dimensional capabilities better than its precedent; and it really makes you feel like part of the world.  Flower care is realistic; and rather than rain or be sunny all day, the weather is unpredictable.  It could be sunny one hour, and rain the next!  You are not the only one who has birthdays either, your neighbors will also occasionally have birthdays; with small parties you can go to.

2.  Three is no longer a crowd!  Sick of talking to Robin?  Oh look, Alice and Limberg are having a chat.  I'm going to eavesdrop on their conversation, because now I CAN!  It's true.  If you see two of your neighbors chatting from across the lawn, there is a small window of opportunity to hear what they are saying.  Just play like you are talking to one of them, and you will hear their conversation; sometimes, you even get to join in!  I think this is pretty cool.

3.  Really cute items.  My absolute favorite item you can get is a picture of a neighbor you get close too.  I love collecting these photos, and putting them in my house.  They come with a small note behind them that represents their personality too.  It's Really cute, and each picture unique.

4.  You get to know a couple of the older characters more personally.  Eventually you will hear the origins of Tom Nook's and Blathers' pasts.  Even Sable will share a few more memories and secrets.  This makes these characters seem more like people, rather than basic CPU.

5.  New characters!  There is a considerable amount new special guests, as well as normal joes and business people.  A couple are a coffee shop pigeon named Brewster, who will warm up to you later, and Blathers' sister, Celeste.

6.  Every old character makes a comeback save for Porter.  They are also better than ever, and have greater influences.  They have been changed a tad, a sample being Gracie doesn't make you wash her car, but their still here.

7.  Accessorize!  Sick of the old princess hat?  Change it!  Unlike the old Animal Crossing, where you could only change your clothes and hat simultaneously with the same outfit, you can change clothes, hats, glasses, and even your hairstyle (hairstyle comes with Tom Nook's biggest store upgrade).  Wear a sunhat with a blue tie die shirt and sunglasses for the beach!  Or even wear a feather you can get from the Boondox!

8.  The game still teaches kids responsibility.  How to live a life on their own, how to make mortgage payments and manage money, even how to do community service.  There is this poor community called the Boondox you can donate bells to.  The more bells you donate, the better off the community is.  Like its precedent, this game has decent life lessons.  It even teaches you should have good insurance!

9.  I hear multiplayer is fun.  I haven't tried this, but talking to people live is good in my opinion.

10.  New tools!  Shoot balloon floating presents out of the sky with a slingshot, or keep track of a few minutes with a timer.

11.  More variety in fish, insects, and seashells.  While it's harder to make money, it's not as boring to fish in the sea.  You can even catch sharks and tarantulas!

12.  No more dump.  Now you have a recycling bin in the post office.  It teaches kids to recycle, while wasting less space and being more attractive.

13.  The game teaches you not to litter.  To demonstrate this example, like its precedent, you fish countless pieced of garbage out of the ocean.  Annoying yes, but teaches a good lesson.

14.  There is new furniture, wallpaper, carpeting, and maybe even more.  Now you can really personalize your house!

15.  The HRA isn't as bad as before.  At least not to me, your neighbors seem to have trouble with them though...  Overall, they aren't as mean and unintelligent as they were before.

So, that's it in a big nutshell.  Truth be told, I could go on with this game for hours, but many details of this game are better experienced than told.  If you are interested in this game, and you own the first Animal Crossing, I recommend comparing their features; this way, you will be sure if you are getting what you want.  It is important you know the differences between the two, so that you understand you are getting a rather different type of gaming experience.  Both games to me are about just as good.  This game lost some serious features, but the new features can make up for it.  It's a great game, but if I haven't stressed it enough, whether I recommend it for you or not, greatly depends on what reason you are interested.  If you are looking for classics from the old nintendo games, want to perform the good glitches, and are not interested in some store raccoon's history, then don't buy this game.  Buy the original Gamecube Animal Crossing.  If you are just looking for some great new and improved fun, are a hard core fan of any Animal Crossing thing in general, and want a fresh in game life experience, then you have a winner here.",The Animal Crossing World Just Got Wilder (by Laura),1185408000,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"01 8, 2013",AH0A0JH8S9YEU,B004YVOCV4,the gamer,"This is a fun assassins creed game if you enjoyed the second game and brotherhood this one adds a bit more story to those games and a few extra little things they added which I feel made the game more polished. It also adds a bit of story to altair's past before he died.

Unfortunately the game is quite short I felt. It felt like it was only half of a regular assassins creed game. I think because they were already working on assassins creed 3 when they were making this and concentrated more on that one and wanted to rush to get this out within the each year a new assassins creed formula.

It had some interesting new additions like bombs which make it a lot more fun making custom bombs. It also added little things like the ability to get into a crowd of people and become incognito and you can usually just let go of the joystick and he walks with them himself without you having to keep up the pace being either to fast or two slow like the previous games.

There is a game crashing bug though that annoyed me to no end. If you wanted to play the Desmond stories about his past in this animus type puzzle things sometimes (at least for me and many other players on the PS3 at least) when you try to go through these rooms to enter that part of the game your system would freeze up and you would have to restart the whole system to get it to work. Some people found ways to get around this by not accepting to enter the first time then going through and accepting it. Or some people found if you ran into them it would crash the game instead of walking. I only made it through the first 3 before not wanting to keep going. It mainly just tells the story of Desmond's childhood but its kinda forgettable.

You also meet subject 13 which he is a very intriguing character. I found myself wanting to know more about him during the game then of Desmond (which is funny cause most people seem to be disliking Desmond's forgettable character). I actually was sad later at what Subject 13 ends up doing. I am not going to spoil it here you can either look it up online or play the game if you really want to know.

At this time I already bought the third game and played this one through a bit faster so that I could play the games in order and unfortunately found that the third game kinda doesn't include these interesting things that this game has. Like where I mentioned when you enter a crowd of people walking the character automatically keeps walking with them. Yeah that's gone in the third game. Seems like they had completely different teams working on these games and didn't allow these improvements to go over into the third game and make it even more polished. I won't go to far into that cause this review is for this game not the third one but I will say the third game wasn't that great to me.

This games story was quite good but again like all the assassin creed games it ends on a cliff hanger like usual. But only for the Desmond story. It kinda seems like a good ending for Altair and for Ezio.

Conclusion:

Fun assassins creed game like its previous ones but unfortunately feels shorter (like by half a game shorter) then the previous ones. I account this from the fact they were working on 3 at the same time as this one I believe. The story is great and its a nice ending to Altair and Ezio. The Desmond stories were forgettable like usual which is a shame. But the introduction of subject 13 was really interesting and a surprise. I dislike the fact he is only around for this game but I guess ubi soft can't make good decisions all the time. Also the game crashing bugs from the Desmond stories is a really bad part of this idk how ubi soft let this ship without noticing that huge bug that's happened to many PS3 players. Really stupid on their part.

For around 20 dollars you can't really miss with this game it is short but the story makes up for it I believe.",Assassins Creed must have assassinated themselves half way through this one,1357603200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Yes, that's Scurge: Hive, not anything with the word Metroid in the title. Despite the derivative storyline, Scurge: Hive for the DS provides some great action and shooting elements that fit right at home on the DS. The overhead isometric view of the game provides for plenty of fun shooting elements to go along with exploration and puzzle solving. Throw in some memorable boss battles to go along with the fluidly animated and colorful graphics and you get one of better recent action/shooters to come out on the DS. What stops Scurge: Hive dead in it's tracks from being an instant classic is that you will backtrack a lot, and I mean a lot. Combine that with the fact that the shooting and puzzle elements will eventually get boring the longer you're in the game, and that stops Scurge: Hive from being a must own. Not to mention that there is a time limit tied into Jenosa's health, which you must constantly find medical stations to refill, which will either add degrees of challenge or frustration depending on the gamer. That aside though, Scurge: Hive is still a great game for DS owners looking for some great action.  The game is also available for the GBA as well, which runs a cheaper price tag but looks pretty much identical to the DS version, although the screen is smaller and the map isn't always displayed.  Not to mention that for some reason, and maybe this is just me, but Scurge: Hive just feels more at home as a GBA game than on the DS, but that's jsut me.

Getouttahere!"" But, since I'm a huge Nintendo addict and buy everything Mario (besides the Super Mario Bros. live action movie), I ended up reserving it for a cool Nintendo PC disc with a bunch of awesome Mario things and getting the game. I was really stoked the more I read about this game. When I actually started playing the game, I discovered it was a nice add-on to the Mario series... but I'd still prefer the classic jumping plumber over a weird water pack that helps you fly/rocket/etc.

The story is a bit different from the other Mario adventures. You are going on vacation and a graffiti punk begins to tag the resort with groovy colors. You're adventure takes you on a rid... a rid of washing paint of everything in sight! Now, I bet you're thinking ""What in the..."" but it's a fun, great Mario game. Still, I feel for you. The premier of a Gamecube Super Mario game should have been Mario in Mushroom Kingdom jumping on Goombas, using Yoshi to eat things, running from football turtles, and beating up on some Koopa kids. But, not here, although `someone' does make an appearance for you to beat the mess out of.

Graphically, this is a good looking game. Mario looks like he should in the 3D world with loads of polygons, loads of animations, and his classic red/blue apparel. Every other character you encounter looks really good too. The basic bosses are well done and that's where the classic Mario shows in the game. For instance, in one area, you fight a giant parana plant, who is really well done (really, really well done). The maps are really well thought out and look amazing. There's an instance where you have to battle on a roller coaster. The game never lags so everything on this ride of how the visuals showcase are in full proportion and really fast.

The game supports Dolby Digital surround sound. Mario + Surround = Awesomeness!! There's a few scenes where they actually did some good voice acting, staring Princess Peach, Toad, and Mario. I really have no complaint about the music at all. As for controls, this game is easy. The only time the game gets hard is the time they take the jet-pack off and you have to navigate some weird jumping puzzles. The reason it's hard is because you're used to the relaxing jet-pack and loose your ability to jump around. Intentional? I don't really know but those puzzles are really dang hard. Camera is the same. The camera is almost perfect in most areas (although some levels the camera is the thing that kills you).

There is some replay value to the game since you get to unlock an alternative costume, a more beach styled costume, to play through the second time. The game is well done so you may want to run through it again, just not right after you finish it.

Overall, I say get this game. It's probably $20 right now and well worth the money. I have never really disliked the game itself, just the fact that Nintendo hasn't released a classic Mario game for the Gamecube. The game though is well done and very fun. Also, in today's high-def age, the game still fairs well overall in the graphics/sounds category.

The opening song alone should make any old-school gamer's heart melt. And the music doesn't let it. It remains good throughout the game.

The gameplay of Solstice is that of a puzzle-platformer. Your wizard's lady-friend is kidnapped and now you need to do something about it. You progress by picking up blocks, jumping on platforms, gathering keys and spells, and so forth. It uses a unique (for the time) diagonal perspective that might be tough to control.

Elexis is the power-mad CEO of SinTek, a genetic research corporation that makes Microsoft look like a dimestore. In the past she has plotted to accelerate human evolution at a faster pace than God allows and her mutations got a little out of hand and started killing people. It looks like she's back to her old tricks again and this time she's enlisted a drug lord named Viktor Radek in an as yet secret plan. And what strange substance has Elexis injected into Blade? It's up to John and his newest partner-in-training, the sexy but inexperienced Jessica Boone to stop this evil duo and save not only Freeport City, but the human race!

Straight-up, Sin is a first person shooter, and a pretty average one at that. That doesn't mean it wasn't fun, but besides the improved graphics, how far is this removed from the first Doom game? The graphics are pretty good but not really that stunning, especially when it comes to outdoor scenes. Where Sin really shines is in combat. That's when the adrenaline begins to pump, even though there's not a lot variety of weapon choice. The keyboard controls were not really ideal, as I found Blade getting stuck on deskchairs, or sliding off ledges when he was supposed to jump forward. The game pulls a fast one by offering you a quick save whenever you want, but if you die, you simply go to the last checkpoint regardless of what point you saved your game, so I felt the ""Quick Save"" was a lie. Something I enjoyed about the game was the sense of danger and exploration. I think this is good start to a nine episode series, IF they can solve the save mirage, and offer more support for a joystick. Also, add more weapons. The only other complaint I have is the laborious process of installing the game. The setup and verification of your game disk is done by ""Steam"", some shadow organization that watches over your every move when you play Sin, a software which is not very simple to uninstall.",MOTHER NATURE WANTS TO RUSH,1152144000,10,,

The Order: 1886 is both of those, but not in a bad way.

Sir Gallahad is one of the knights of the round table, that started with King Arthur.

It has been around for centuries, and many of the people sitting around the table have seen more than any one person is meant to.

Still, they are all tasked with protecting the innocent from Lycans and a new threat, the rebellion.

Most of the story is your standard conspiracy theory, with the player trying to figure out what's going on with the rebels and amongst The Order.

I never felt any particular attachment with the characters, and you might not either.

The gunplay is pretty well tuned, and reminds myself of the Gears of War franchise (as you may have read elsewhere online).

There is no multiplayer (not a huge deal), nor is there any co-op (a bigger deal, for me at least).

The fact that you are usually with another person, makes it seem like they could've put the time in to add the ability to play with another character.

When I decided to purchase a new video game system, I had a very difficult time in knowing which system to buy. I could've bought the Xbox or Playstation 2, largely because of the value of games they've each came up with. Instead, I felt it was a wiser move to purchase the Gamecube from Nintendo. I think it was a much wiser mover, because it was easier to drag around, and because of the games that were available for it. One of them, really reminds me so well of a classic. Mario Kart has been considered as one of the Top 5 racing games of all time, accoriding to the Nickelodeon GAS show Play 2 Z. When I got to play this one, I thought it was much fiercer than ever before.
Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, is the first Mario Kart release to really have a massive impact, since Mario Kart 64 back in 1997. The game takes on a true new light, as not one, but 2 different characters range with special weapons, and much more difficult tracks than the previous Mario Kart. The graphics really stand out on all the tracks as a premium that Gamecube has brought for about the past few years, and the game has more than ever. The game has the exact same number of courses and surprises that was in the previous one, but the oponents are tougher and make your road to #1 a lot harder. I also have to admit, the idea of swapping the team during the middle of the race also makes the pace a lot harder to go around, and the carts are definitely cute to fierce, depending on the status of your driving. I also like the idea of the internet device that can be used to add to the mayhem of Mario Kart. It just makes the game a lot more exciting, considering that just came out recently too. The game stands out a whole lot more than other racers at this time, largely because other racing games are exactly just the same these days.
This is the very first game I've ever purchased for the Gamecube, since I bought the game system just recently too.

And its great you'll have tone of fun intimidating shop owners, beating up rival families and taking over their business as well but it can get repetitive for many players as taking over businesses is mandatory on most of the story progression. But what many players will grow tired of fast is their business being taken over every five minutes and this will be constant throughout the whole game unless you take out the other mob families and their made men.

I bought this to replace my older bluetooth headset that I primarily used on my PS3. When I first saw this, I thought it looked decent, and I thought the stand was pretty neat as well. And at $60, I didn't think that was too bad.

Sharp,"The ""Pandora's box"" in this fine game is actually a decrepit, creepy ship, floating alone on oily seas and containing dark secrets, imminent danger and no crew, at least no live crew. In mythology, women are uncompromisably curious,so Pandora had to look in the box, unleashing evils into the world; Lot's wife had to look back for a last glimpse of Sodom and Gomorrah and she was turned into a pillar of salt. Who is Laura, the one woman in the game and why is she left alive on the ghostly ship? Did Laura create a Pandora's box out of the ship turning it into a vessel of evil? A beautiful girl like this could not be responsible for the grisly deaths on the Pandora or could she? But something is on board with a taste for human blood is guarding the evil cargo of the abandoned ship.

You as the young man Matthew board the ship and are immediately immersed in mystery as you investigate the eerie ship atmosphere, and as usual in hidden object games, you have to be an expert handyman-  digging, sawing, cutting, sewing, gluing, and running hither and yon, sometimes in the bowels of the ship, sometimes under water.

The human figures in the game are a bit stiff and the cut scenes are really amateurish, but the hidden object scenes located behind twinkly blue lights are beautiful. Perhaps some of the creators of the game have English as a second language as there are some rather funny definitions, such as ""loud hailer"" for loud speaker and ""chandelier"" for candelabra, and there's some problem as to what constitutes a bowl, a pan, a dish or a cauldron, but these are minor quirks.

Vampire Saga:Pandora's Box is fun, and that's the main thing. There's a humdinger of an ending, too, and the game is intriguing enough to keep you going, but it is not hard. The production is not quite in the same league as ""Return to Ravenhearst"" and ""Dire Grove"" but the sound is top notch with creaking ropes and eerie ship sounds and you'll really almost believe you are trapped on a very wet, clammy, scary old war horse of a ship.

This feeling has more to do the level of competition at high end of the RPG market than it does with any real lack in the latest in the Star Ocean series.  The truth is that this really is a great game, but has just a few flaws.

The story finds us at Hyda, a resort planet, with teenagers Fayt Leingod and Sophia Esteed.  In short order the station comes under alien attack, the couple flee, and after a series of misadventures are separated.  The story continues to follow Fayt he is 'rescued' by anti-federation forces (I'm not going to try to explain all the politics) and finally crashes on Elicoor II, a world about Victorian level technology and a reliance on powers that a partly magical and partly science.  Fayt, and his new friend Cliff Fitter become embroiled in the conflicts of Elicoor II.  At each stage the solution to one problem leads to the discovery of one even more complicated, until Fayt and a collection of friends are struggling to save the universe.

This is a complex plot, and the settings of the story (Elicoor and elsewhere) provide countless options for development and support many styles of gameplay.  I found the battle system a bit awkward - you fight using a selected group of up to three people.  You can switch among the people, or set them on automatic and pick an overall style for each.  This can take a bit of getting used to.  You can also learn skills, buy, invent or find weapons and other materials.  In fact, an entire sub-game is devoted to an inventors competition were you take your invention to an agent who evaluates it, creates a marketing plan, and ranks both Fayt and npc inventors.  Thus character development is an intense task.

Artwork for the game is good, with believable animation.  Not enough different monsters, though, so fighting can get a bit repetitious.  The CG scenes are excellent as well.  Dialog gets a bit thin in spots, with each character having a very short list of victory exclamations.  Somewhere about the 1,000th battle you will be ready to strangle on or another character.  It is interesting how Fayt grows from being a whiney teenager and apprentice prig into a young man who is willing to take full responsibility for his part in things.

This has been a sparse year for fantasy RPG's.  This game and Shadow Hearts 2 are the both best of the crop and nearly the only entries for the PS2.  If you are a fan of the genre you will enjoy this game a great deal, with its interesting and unique approach.  Like all RPG's there is plenty of violence, but there is also a refreshing lack of rude language and overt sexuality.  Recommended.",Novel and Interesting,1100563200,15,,
4.0,True,"02 8, 2016",A2AAQ4FI1YTUBE,B007CS9WYI,Calvin,"In The Box:
First off, the razer Tiamat 7.1 is a very well-made headset. It comes in a nice box with a magnetic latch and opening it was overall a great unboxing experience. It came with two side covers and a few cable accessories (to plug into the amp to switch it to speakers was the accessory and honestly I really like it because now I can use a simple button to switch between speakers and headset.) The headset does not have any adjusters but instead you just put it on your head and it's headband adjusts to your head for you. Saving you a lot of time. All the cables are braided and quite thick (because you are running 7 cables or more through it) There is an amplifier with a volume controller for all the speakers in the headset, a mute button, a speakers button, a 7.1 button, and a microphone button.

Comfort:
The headset is a little lighter than I thought it would be and has memoryfoam earcups. Because of this, they took around about an hour to get a bit uncomfortable. This is because the memoryfoam can feel a bit hard after a while. Other than that, the headband was nice a snug but sometimes moved around when my head did.

Sound Quality:
Upon further inspection of the headset (when I took the ear pads off) It seemed that there ARE 5 speakers in each ear cup as advertised, but, some of them are actually of quite low quality. This is because razer can't afford to put 5 high-quality drivers in each ear cup because that would be too expensive for the consumer. Honestly though, this does affect the surround sound quality by making it a bit harder to differentiate between speaker channels (specifically rear channels) but other than that it doesn't sound too bad. Although I do have to note that the bass in stereo mode is a bit overwhelming because they are driving too much power to the subwoofer in that mode and then the subwoofer can barely be heard in 7.1 mode because it doesn't have enough power.

Conclusion:
Honestly, if you have a really good sound card and want amazing 7.1 sound quality from a headset, this will do the job. But if you don't have an amazing sound card and have a bit of extra cash, then try getting a 3D surround sound headset. Because they only have one speaker, the sound is usually higher quality, and most 3D surround sound headsets are wireless. I would personally recommend the Recon 3D from creative or even the FREQ 9 from madcatz.","Not A Bad Headset, but for the price I would have rather gotten a ""3D surround sound"" headset",1454889600,,,

Other than that nonsense, here are noteable points about the system.
1) Comes with two cradles for the Wii you gamepad (one of them charges the game page so you do not need to keep buying batteries)
2) You can transfer your games from your old Wii to the Wii U using the Wii Transfer tool (Note: you need to download this through virtual console on both systems and you need to have an SD card (sold separately as well))
3) After transferring all your games from the Wii over to the Wii U, you can still play Wii game disks on the Wii-U with all of your Wii controllers that you've used on the Wii (Classic or Pro)
4) Has a couple great games that are built right into the system with no separate disk required (Super Mario 3 and Nintendoland) both are rated E for everybody
5) You can download games onto the WII-U using the virtual console app (Wii-U games (Demo version or full), NES, SNES and Nintendo 3DS games only).

What is that thing?
In case you didn't read that long description above, the game is centered around Alex Mercer a guy with a shady past that wakes up a changed man. He has the ability to jump, run, climb, and kill way better than us. He also has the ability to absorb people to gain their memories and their identity.

The game follows his story as he tries to protect loved ones and figure out what the hell happened to him. As you progress and gain ""Evolution Points"" from missions you can upgrade Alex with new abilities including some crazy attacks that just devastate everything around you.

The setting is Manhattan (seems like everyone wants to ruin NYC) and you can literally run around and up anything. Once you get used to it (it's pretty simple to figure out how to run up buildings), it's pretty liberating. It's what I wished I could've done in GTA IV. You can climb the highest building and jump off of it. Traveling via rooftops gives you that Spidey feeling but without all that webbing. My only problem with it is that your ability to turn and fine tune your moves while sprinting is limited so you'll find yourself flying off rooftops once in a while. Still, nothing beats the almost animal running and leaping style Alex has...it's really fun.

Did I mention Wolverine?
At the core of the game is the combat and you get a taste of just how addictive it can get at the start of the game. You're introduced to Alex's abilities, Hollywood style, in the middle of a climactic battle. You've got access to nearly all of his abilities as you get used to navigating and the like. The story will then take you to the beginning and you start with minimal abilities that you'll have to unlock over time. Still, it's a great feeling when you can just jump into the middle of a huge battle (mutants, tanks, helos, etc.) and just devastate. It reminds me of Wolverine (the game) except on a much larger scale. And, this includes the blood, gore and violence. If you're not into that sort of stuff, stop reading and find another game.

Why You'll Like This Game:
- You feel really powerful once you've developed some of your powers
- You'll get a kick out of leaping around the city, raining devastation on your enemies.
- You liked Wolverine but thought there wasn't enough to do
- You can save anywhere despite the checkpoint saves.
- Learning the story through random bits of memories you grab off people is a pretty damned cool plot mechanic.
- With a large city, there's plenty to do with side missions in the form of races, kill tasks (kill X soldiers in Y seconds), etc. and various markers to grab for EP.

Why You Won't Like This Game:
- Lots of gore, blood and body parts...c'mon, he's a mutant up against other mutants and military out to kill him.
- The crowds and traffic are as generic as GTA's.
- Graphics are solid but they aren't fancy. Lots of fog to ruin those potentially amazing vistas.
- Like GTA, if you're not doing missions or other tasks, there's only so much fun to be derived from destroying cars and killing soldiers and mutants. Also, like GTA, you will end up killing civies so you'd better hope your moral compass doesn't get in your way.
- While there's lots to do, I doubt you'll want to replay this game over and over once you've completed it.

All in all, this is a fun game (it's hard to not say yes to ""Just one more mission""). If you loved Wolverine or GTA, then you should definitely try this one out.","Hitman, GTA and Wolverine all rolled into one...",1246320000,36,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The Bad: Dual screen combat just doesn't work, can be extremely hard sometimes, a bit long winded for a portable game

I first have to mention that this game was made by the extremely talented Square Enix and Tetsuya Namura was behind this (Final Fantasy VII, Kingdom Hearts). The World Ends With You is an RPG like no other. They took the cliche elements of RPGs and twisted them around so much it's an enjoyable new welcome. First off, the story is the strong point here. You wake up in Shibuya without your memory and all you have is a Player Pin and you have to stop the Noise and find your way back to the Real Ground. The combat in here is great, but is the most flawed part of the game. You use the stylus to fight with Neku by using Player Pins. Think of these pins as weapons with different attributes. You can tap empty space to send sparks flying, shout in the mic to create a shockwave, slack up on Neku to hit enemies, healing pins, some pins have you drawing circles to send meteors crashing, some pins use telekinesis to send signs, cones, and even cars flying into your enemies. On the top screen you control your partner (there are three throughout the game) by using the D-pad or the face buttons.

This is where it's flawed; controlling two screens at a time does not work. You either have to focus on one or the other, but what makes it harder is yo have a combo tree when you hit the button and you have to much up certain cards to make a fusion pin appear for a super powerful attack. This is really difficult and annoying because some fights make you control both. You can, however, have the game do it on it's own, but the AI seems to be flawed since if you don't you'll lose health really fast.

With that aside everything else is great. While you run around Shibuya you can visit stores and buy clothes (think armor) to increase attack and defense etc. What's neat about this is each section of Shibuya has a ""brand chart"" and if you wear those clothes or pins you get attack or stat bonuses. This is also the other flaw in the game, each section is a tiny little area so you're not going to stop through ever section and change your layout out so you just have to use what you like and try to make it popular by fighting the Noise. While we're on that the Noise are the enemies in the game. You can scan the area with your Player Pin and they all show up as red symbols. Tap these (or more than one for a chain battle) to level up and fight them. When each day of the Game starts you have missions you have to complete via your phone and you have to get past walls that the Reapers put up. To get past these you have to meet objectives such as defeat this many Noise, buy me this or that, take this quiz etc. This tosses things around and makes you want to keep playing. You can add to your attributes as well without leveling up by eating food. These food have to be digested through battles and after so many bites you'll get the stat. You can also change your level to drop more pins as well if you need some good ones.

Of course, this is a Square Enix game so it is dialog heavy and there are text based cut scenes every five minutes. This adds to the incredible story though so it's all ok. The graphics are all 2D but they have the same art style as Kingdom Hearts, it looks like, thanks to Tetsuya Nomura. The sounds is a bunch of swishing and bleeping but the music is pretty nice. There are dozens of tracks you can buy in stores. Overall if you can stomach to odd combat design and you want a great story driven game then go for this. This is too complicated for a portable game, but for some odd reason it still works. I think Square tried to take advantage of the hardware a little too much but this game will sit in our hearts along with Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts because I know it has for me.","An overlooked classic, but can be extremely hard",1332979200,,,

Honestly, it's hard not to compare them when they really are exactly the same, but it's got it's advantages and while it's not the GameCube controller that I would have much rather have seen on the Wii U, it gets the job done.

Pros:
 - Analog sticks are fantastic. They feel great and the I'm a huge fan of the convex design that Nintendo and Sony use as oppose to the concave design Xbox uses.
 - Wireless Bluetooth means I can use it on my PC, but the software isn't there yet to emulate the Xbox controller for PC games.
 - D-Pad is phenomenal, slightly better than the DualShock D-Pads which is saying a lot.
 - Bottom side has a great grainy texture that makes it comfortable to play for long periods and with sweaty/oily hands.
 - Rechargeable battery with fantastic battery life.
 - Light
 - Incredibly solid. I could not get this thing to creak no matter how much force I put into it. It's feels unbreakable.
 - Extremely comfortable.

Cons:
 - Face button position. The positioning is not bad in it of itself but most of the developers are not using it correctly. For instance, a shooter like Call of Duty has the two most important buttons (Jump and Reload) mapped on B and Y, which is where the Xbox and PS3 versions would have it. However, on the Pro controller these buttons are the furthest away from the analog stick, meaning I need to reach a farther distance to get to my most important buttons. This is not a huge problem for many first party Nintendo games where they place the priority on the A and X buttons, but it's a pain when a developer just sloppily ports their games and copies the exact button arrangement from another console without thinking about this.
 - No data is sent through the mini USB port. This means that competitive gamers will always have to rely on wireless even when they're playing wired, which is ridiculous.
 - No headset jack. This and the point above is why pro gamers can't take this console seriously.
 - No analog triggers. This is a problem for me when I'm playing racing games because I need to control the speed of my vehicle and the shoulder buttons simply don't let me do that.

I know I listed a lot of cons but it's a really well-built controller overall and it feels great. There are a lot of features lacking when coompared to the DualShock 3 like analog triggers, motion sensors, dual rumble, extensive PC support, etc. and it's disappointing mainly because they're around the same price point.

Here come some pros and cons of the game
PROS
1- You r the lider of a group of rebels that fight against the new Russian (red) order, so this offer you the ability of recruit some rebels that wants to joins the cause, this is real funny because U can control until 12 rebels, and give orders just like:
-Scout, Defend Positinos, Attack specific targets or areas,etc.
2-The Music is really good
3-Quick Saves (you can save your progress on sewers entrance) are really usefuls since the misions demands a lot of time.
Cons
1- The graphics could be better
2- The weapons, sometimes is hard to find the right weapon for the job, specially when you're carring the Machine Gun and want to pick up a Sniper rifle, YOU cant carry Both... NOT like GTA
3- I do not like some control moves, for example if you are on a situacion of cross or heavy fire and you need to use a Health pack.
Basically for these 3 reason I don't give the 5 stars, BUT Definitely FF is a vary GOOD game and a MUST BUY for most PS2 Gamers.","Good Game... Good Story (Looks Like ""the Thing"")",1069804800,5,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

I love the multiplayer in it because they include NPC's and they are justly worth less than killing an actual player, and I think than a tian. You also level up, and the levels seem pretty balanced. There is a pretty good gun (the RC101-A I think) available from level 1, so players don't have to rely on using the smart pistol all of the time.

Also it is fun to be able to double-jump, wall-run, and ride titans like anytime. I personally like to shout PARKOUR after most things I do because it is so fullfilling.

Lost Planet definitely has some downsides, however, these cons do not make the game worthy of avoiding.

For example, one of the most annoying parts of Lost Planet is the fact that a 5 gigabyte installation of content is required before you can play. Another downside is that the same button is used to exit your vehicle as to pick up weapons for that vehicle, meaning you could be trying to pick up some much needed ammo and instead find yourself jumping out of your vehicle directly into harms way. And, despite the massive content installation, there are still a few points in the game where frames will be dropped and the screen will hang up a bit. However, these things I believe gamers will find to be forgivable.

Now for the pros...Gameplay for one. I found the game to be a unique and rather entertaining mix of first/third-person action and mech-style combat. Parts of the game you will play on foot while others will be impossible without a VS (mech.) Also, the graphics are pretty nice, granted this game did come out a while ago (and it's a 360 port...) so they are not as impressive as more recent releases. The cutscenes, however, I found to be very nice.

Overall, I found Lost Planet to be a worthwhile gaming experience, despite the flaws. The originality of the game definitely makes it worth checking out.","Not Brilliant, But Unique",1208304000,47,,

Obviously, if you bought it then you were paying five dollars more than you have to.  Now the Wii points card is at an affordable price, and it's not so bad.  This one comes with 2000 points.  That's equivalent to twenty dollars, and you'll need it to be able to download virtual console games and other wii-ware (if they so charge you for it).

I'll be the first to admit that I probably wouldn't buy a Wii Points card right off the bat simply because I'm comfortable buying points directly from the network and charging the to my card.  This brings up the question as to why ANYONE would spend money to buy a wii points card at all.  Don't be shocked when you see people doing it.  There are a couple of good reasons.

Firstly: There's sales tax.  In certain states when you charge to your credit card, you're paying more than twenty dollars to purchase wii points.  With the Wii Points card, there are no taxes.  EVER.  Not even when you buy it in the store.  So some people save an extra buck or two by buying the card as opposed to charging to their credit card.

Second: They make fantastic gift cards, especially if you happen to know someone who can't get enough of classic gaming!  If you really know someone who loves classic games, you can help this person out by just giving them a Wii Points card.

Third: Maybe for some reason (be that you hate them or whatever) you don't have a credit card.  How then, is one supposed to purchase Wii Points without a credit card?  So you can do the next best thing, just simply get a Wii Points card.

When you do find money the first place it goes is into repairing your armor and weapons which most of the time you won't have enough money to so then next time you get money .. its all gone again.

Let's first talk about the improvements made to the new PS3. This 40gb version adds new blu-ray features, as well as a 65nm cpu, which runs cooler and theoretically will last longer. 40gb is obviously twice as large as the 20gb. Now for the bad, the really bad. PS2 Compatibility is completely gone. This is an extremely large issue for me. Why? Because it further limits the potential games you can play on this ""multi-media machine."" Yes, it has blu-ray, but watching a regular DVD on my HD-TV via an upconverting player, I only can see a slight difference.

Why did I give it 4 stars? The Good: Wifi, Blu-ray, superb graphics and an improving Playstation Network are all features of this bad boy. The hardware really has a ton of untapped potential, potential that will probably be fully used only after another 12-18 months. This is because the cpu inside, ""the cell processor"", is rather tricky to make games for, but extremely powerful at math, graphics  etc. I hopped into the PSN just hours after setting up my PS3 and bought Mortal Kombat II for $4.99, which was very cool. I'm very impressed by the built in OS, the hardware, the quality of the system and just about everything else. So what's the catch?

There is unfortunately a really big downside, a total lack of games. What were the franchise games that built PS2? GTA, Gran Turismo, Tekken, Madden, Resident Evil and Final Fantasy. GTA IV just hit 3 days ago, Madden has been a bust and GT5 Prologue, as previously discussed, is a waste of time. This is the (only) arena where XBOX 360 has been stronger but it has been a big advantage for Microsoft. Buyers be warned, the newest XBOX 360's are still sporting 20% hardware failure rates.

In conclusion, if you want a future proof (and extremely reliable) blu-ray/gamestation, I highly recommend this machine. However, if you need something you can plug in and play all the top titles on tomorrow, you'll be a bit disappointed. I still recommend buying this system because it has a brightening future.

I am a bit biased since I loved the gameplay of Bioshock 1, and I'm a huge System Shock 2 fanboy.  After reading reviews on problem-laced installations/activations, I still took a chance. Fortunately, I had no issues with downloading (under 2 hours) or installing, and the whole Windows Live bit went smoothly (although slightly annoying): just check you e-mail and activate/verify your account. I don't understand the complaint online activation...if you are downloading a multiple-gigabyte game, you most likely have some form of broadband, so I'd imagine you are always ""online"" anyway, but I may be ignorant to some folks' setups.

It tells its story in a way no previous game has been able to pull off. It's a competent mystery tale with plenty of twists and forks. Also, at times it's amazing graphically -- excelling in facial expressions, water effects, and cinematography.

With all this said, why not give the game 5 stars? Two things really bugged me. First off, the control wasn't as good as it should be. Granted, I played on the most difficult level, but the Sixaxis steering was constantly flat-out wrong. And at times, it just plain didn't recognize the correct inputs. This can be the difference between succeeding at a task and failing.

Secondly, I had some problems with the story -- don't worry, I won't spoil anything. In a game like this, which gives you so many choices, there are times the characters just aren't allowed to do things you think would be second-nature. If I'm a cop fighting someone and there are a bunch of police nearby, why wouldn't I yell to them? It seems everyone here is a mute unless it befits the story.

Heavy Rain is an experience I recommend all serious gamers try. You may not love it, but it's an important step in gaming.

The graphics are incredible. The driving is fantastic. The cars are beautiful works of customizable art. And the nearly endless amount of races keep the game fresh for Days, Weeks, months, and even years. But enough about the good (which is in every previous review). Now to the flaws....

The Flaws:
The story line is nearly nil and un-motivating. Though there are plenty of challenges, races, points to earn and such, I am a big fan of games that offer large DLC packs to expand and extend the game. It keeps you playing for years to come. With Forza Horizon 2 the only DLC's you can get are just different cars you can drive and there doesn't seem to be any new extensions coming. It would be great to have more challenges, places, points to earn, ect...

As the game exists now, there are very small gripes to be said. It is really a fun game and my whole family loves it (Wife, 8yr old boy, 4yr old boy, 18yr old boy, and me a 33yr Man). It can get old if you are playing it continuously for long periods without playing other games as a pallet cleanser, but it is a game you will play for months or years if you play it off and on between games and activities that have more story with loftier goals.

4.0,False,"12 1, 2005",A3TK2IOP8UQ087,B00009WDLD,Alabaster Jones,"To understand this game's place in gaming history, it will help to understand the history of its developers.  Ion Storm was founded by John Romero and Tom Hall, the minds behind Doom.  Doom was, and probably still is,  the most widely known game in the FPS genre.  With its creators breaking off from ID software to form their own company, all eyes were already on Ion Storm from the very beginning.  The company had 2 branches: One in Austin, and one in Dallas.  The Dallas branch of Ion Storm spent years working on the game Daikatana.  Due to the amount of publicity the company and their game were receiving, Daikatana was highly anticipated by many gamers, who were champing at the bit to get their hands on what promised to be the best game ever made.  However, due in part to the excessively long development time (for the day), and the frustratingly wonky AI, Daikatana was finally released to painfully bad reviews all around.  The game ended up selling very poorly, and was directly responsible for the both the closing of the Dallas IS branch, and for the departure of Romero and Hall from the company.

Daikatana should have been the death of Ion Storm, and surely would have been if it hadn't been for what was happening in the Austin branch.  About the same time Daikatana was released, Ion Storm Austin completed work on and released a little known game called Deus Ex.  Deus Ex was a mix of FPS and RPG, which played like an interactive ""choose your own adventure"" sci-fi novel. Unlike Daikatana, Deus Ex was released to critical acclaim, and went on to sell very well.  It even won 2000s Game of the Year award.  Deus Ex singlehandedly saved the should-be-ruined Ion Storm from collapse.

Fast forward 3 years.  News of Deus Ex 2 comes.  Once again, in what can only be a cruel act of fate, Ion Storm was plagued with  a long development process, as well as the attention and anticipation of gamers everywhere.  You know where this is going, right?  The reviews on this site should deem it unnecessary for me to describe what happened when Invisible War was released.  I'll just say that it was universally panned, and die-hard fans of Deus Ex were, almost without exception, entirely disappointed with the game.  Shortly after DX2 was released, Ion Storm released another highly anticipated game, Thief III.  While not as critically panned as DX2, the game didn't sell very well, and was plagued with many of the same issues that DX2 apparently suffered from.

As a result, Eidos, Ion Storm's parent company, decided to close the doors at Ion Storm forever.

What should have been a return to greatness ended up being the end for one of the most ambitious and talented game development companies in the world.

Personally, I like DX2.  It's a bit smaller than the first game, and the story doesn't seem as inspired, but it's still a couple of steps above your average gaming fare.  There is a lot of freedom to enjoy yourself in this game, and,  like the first game, you can choose what type of person you will be.  You can chose to be a diplomat, a hardcore killer, or anything in between.  The only thing that I don't like about this game is the size of the play areas.  At times, the buildings are so tiny, you can't even move without bumping into something.  Other than that, the game is worthy of the Deus Ex name, in my opinion.  Even if it lacks something that the first game had, it is still worth checking out - ESPECIALLY at this price.",The game that killed the best game developer in North America.,1133395200,24,,

No sooner does the player arrive when he realizes something is not right, as Malaria leaves them wracked and helpless, as their target gloats over them.

A quick fight follows which gets the game into motion as you become hired by a local faction to run various missions. At this point, players are introduced to allies and various locales as they run missions for payments. The local currency is diamonds and they more you earn, then the better the weapons at your disposal.

In a clever twist, weapons can jam or become defective, so obtaining new weapons is vital. Unlike most 3D shooters, new weapons are not obtained by simply taking them from fallen enemies. Players must instead locate weapons supply areas and purchase or repair new weapons with their diamonds.
This new wrinkle drives the game as players have extra incentive not only to complete assigned missions but side missions and explore as well. There are Diamonds throughout the map, and by using your map and GPS, you can locate diamonds scattered throughout the map.

Aside from main missions, there are side missions that allow players to earn more diamonds, but add a great chance to explore the map. Ubisoft Montreal has paid great attention to the detail of the landscape and provide players with over 50 square Kilometers of stunningly detailed maps to explore.
There are vehicles throughout the game, as driving cars and boats allow for easier travel between locales as well as a quick escape during firefights.

The enemy A.I. is where some of the rough spots of the game arise as they rarely do anything unique to avoid your attacks. I often use F.E.A.R. to compare A.I. as enemies that pull tables over to provide cover, shoot over the top of open doorways, and jump out windows to flank you. Many of the Far Cry 2 enemies took a direct path to me, and did not make to many enthusiastic efforts to evade me.

Thankfully this situation improved as the game went on, and resulted in some very intense firefights and when you gain allies as the game goes along, you can get some very challenging scenarios. One situation had me pose as bait to draw the enemies out so my ally could dispatch them.

The game does have plenty to offer for fans of multiplay as the game offers Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising mode for up to 16 players and I really love the ability to use vehicles in my online matches and take great delight in driving my opponents under my wheels especially when there are snipers in the area.

The inclusion of fire is a great feature as with so much tall grass, being able to burn out your enemies with a well placed shot is loads of fun. Be warned as your stray shots can ignite fires that will singe you as well.

Another new inclusion is the need for players to consume Malaria medication to stay functional. This causes players to be aware of their supply of the medication and to seek out more medication when their supply runs low.

Weapons in multiplay also require players to purchase them, as the better you play, the better your income which allows you to upgrade your arsenal. Players can take part in ranked and unranked matches as well, and being able to track your progress.

The graphics in the game are top of the line and the rich detail paid to the landscape is truly a breathtaking moment in gaming. The sound and voice acting is solid if unspectacular but sets up the action and story of the game well.

While Far Cry 2 has a few blemishes like the map size, lack of a prone position, respawing bad guys, and some repetitive missions, there is plenty of good stuff here to make this a worthy game for any action fan and one of the more ambitious titles of the year.

It's the 3rd chapter in the True Crime: series after things went south between the developers and Activision
The third chapter in the True Crime series was doa
Luckily for the gaming community Square Enix bought the license and the original True Crime team also joined Square Enix
And we got True Crime III now re-branded as Sleeping Dogs

In terms of how far True Crime evolved between the Original True Crime: Streets of L.A. up to Sleeping Dogs
it's awe inspiring I think this game does GTA better then the last two GTA did

I bought the last gen version of Sleeping Dogs for the XBox360 the week it came out
i only bought the Definitive Edition mostly cause i got a great deal on it
Is it a amazing Remastering or a cheap money grab ???
It's in the middle

Graphics: Is a mixed bag
at times the game looks flat out stunning (the rain effects are flawless)
other times the game has/had bugs and glitches (by now i'd hope there's been a patch or two?) other times the game looks like the 360 version
Keep in mind last time i played it was March 2015

Audio is awesome DTS 5.1 (i wish they added new licensed music to the radio stations)
as far as open world games this is really bad in terms of music it only works if you live in Asia
They should've jazzed up the soundtrack for more regions imo

The Story is really solid! It's written like a Hollywood big budget film (It's one of the best story driven open-world titles ever!)

The Controls: are a B-
The third person hand to hand combat and gun play is strong
But, the driving seems off to me (some of the races i beat on the 360 are stacked and unbalanced on this version
The Controls are Not balanced if you compare them to the previous version

Lots of bang for your buck!
The one major saving grace for this version you get all the DLC on the disc (plus lots of extras clothes some very cool looking)
the first story driven dlc Nightmare in North Point is still a fun little added chapter
the second major story driven dlc
Zodiac Tournament is a massive broken mess (keep in mind i played this chapter March 2015) during the half way point the game either froze up on me or crashed my console........... i tired to get info regarding this massive bug but, contacting United Front Games was a pain in the neck so i put the game down and tapped-out I'd thinking by now approaching Thanksgiving '15 there has been a few patches for this problem?!?!

Overall is it worth a double dip? that all depends if you miss the previous Gen version my answer to you would be Yes without a doubt

Appearance wise- this looks awesome!
The resistance on the triggers and the buttons (RB & LB) is little less than the original Xbox controller, but I think I will be okay with it.
There is more resistance on the left trigger than the right trigger. Also, the feed back on ""X"" button is weaker than the other three. And no, it's not because my right hand is the dominant hand. I felt these as soon as I held it and started pushing buttons.
Another thing I noticed was that the finish on the right side corner is not smooth (the part where your palm touches); the bottom piece sticks out about 1mm outward. It's very very very subtle and it seems soooo insignificant, but I can feel it. I think anybody can. So every time I re-position the controller in my hand, it irritates me.
On the positive side, it has small button on the back. You can turn the light off if you want. It has on/ off/ active mode you can cycle through.
It looks sick paired with my laptop. Overall, I am happy with this new controller. It's almost perfect, but not 100% though.

I don't think I've used a keyboard with such a great tactile feel and satisfying audible feedback since my original IBM AT keyboard. The amount of force required to type is perfectly balanced, for me.  I can rest my hands on the keys without accidental strokes.  Previous membrane keyboards felt like they required more force to register strokes, so typing on the G610 feels effortless.
The backlighting makes it easier to use in low light setting.  Although the board has a button that allows you to change brightness of the backlighting, the default setting is to have the keys light up in a 'wave'.  Since the human eye is attracted to motion, I find it very distracting to have a wave of light travel across my keyboard. I wish the default setting was to have a constant backlighting, so this is where my rating falls to 4 stars.  I'd prefer to not install more software on my PC, but I was forced to install Logitech's software to control the backlighting.
Another minor complaint is the placement of the caps lock/scroll lock/num lock indicator lights.  To make room for media control buttons, the indicator lights were moved to the top middle of the board, where it is not so intuitive to figure out which light is which.

4.0,False,"04 1, 2009",A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B001ET07O0,Terry Mesnard,"The joys of renting a game came to me last night.  I'm not normally one who rents games.  I'm all about purchasing them.  However, here is a game that I've wanted to play really badly and yet didn't want to buy it and last night proved it a worthy rental but lousy (for me, at least) purchase.  Throwing away the presentation from the previous House of Dead games and upping the b-grade feel to epic proportions, Overkill apes the Grindhouse (as presented by Tarantino and Rodriguez, but mostly Rodriguez) films and does almost everything Planet Terror does, only in virtual form and not as well.

There's the lines through the screen, the cheesy 70s ""enjoy the movie"" screen, a completely non sequitur stripper sequence, missing reels, cheesy dialogue, scenes that abruptly end and more cursing than you'll know how to deal with.  In fact, according the Guinness Book of World Records, Overkill comes in as the ""most profane game"" with a recorded 189 counts of the ""F word,"" which doesn't take into account the other multitude of swear words available.  It's not so much as they curse as there's really not much to the dialogue without the cursing.  There's a lot of cussing, I guess is the take away from this.

It's a bit gratuitous, even for a ""grindhouse"" game. That said, the game is very entertaining from the story perspective in that it makes as little sense as other House of the Dead games.  It's obviously not supposed to and the grindhouse theme is endearing, if sometimes off-putting.  However, from a gameplay perspective, Overkill is just okay.  It's a fairly standard on rails shooter that doesn't really offer much new.  In between levels you can purchase new weapons or upgrades to existing weapons, if you die during a level you can spend some of your points you've racked up that level to get another life and there's items in the environment you can shoot for power-ups (slow-mo-fo, life, grenades).  Bosses, in traditional House of the Dead fashion, have weak spots that are shown to you prior to your fight.

The thing is, Overkill is too easy.  It wasn't until the last few levels that we even upgraded our weapons, we never purchased a new weapon and we only died a handful of times.  I think the biggest problem with Overkill is that there's no sense of escalating difficulty or tension.  It's as easy by the end of the game as it is in the beginning.  In fact, the hardest boss for us was actually the first one, followed by the two before the final boss, but even then they weren't that difficult...by difficult, I mean we died once or twice fighting them.

On one hand I appreciated this, since I played it with a casual gamer who wasn't used to these types of games and we managed to get through it.  But, on the other, it really lessens the feeling of accomplishment and the whole thing becomes rather repetitive.  Further exasperating the repetitive nature of Overkill is the use of repeated enemies.  About 99% of the enemies you'll fight are of the mutant (because the zombie word is verboten) variety, but there's only three real types: males ones, fat male ones and female ones.  Each level, these three types get reskinned so that the fat one will move from wearing hickish farming clothes to operating clothes to chef clothes.  The women will go from strippers to nurses and beyond.  But it's really the same three enemy types, dressed up like Barbie and Ken dolls, but not really different.

Once in awhile, Overkill spruces things up with a couple different enemy types but for almost the entire game you're fighting the same three enemies, which adds to the repetition.  Doesn't help that the game's graphics look really bland.  I've seen graphics of better caliber on the last generation's gaming system.  And there's slowdown!  It's not game-breaking but there's constantly pauses and stutters as the game loads.  It's very noticeable.

In the end, Overkill is an enjoyable game that's made so more because of the presentation than the actual gameplay, slightly bringing the rating up.  Oh, did I mention it took about 2.5 hours or so to complete?  Yeah.  Sure, finishing it opens up a few different modes like a four player multiplayer game, a ""director's cut"" mode that ups the difficulty and supposedly adds a bit of length to the game and a handful of minigames.  But it's really short, even for a on rails game and you'd get better bang for  your buck with Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles.

This is what Fallout 3 would have been if there was a multiplayer mode.

This is another game set off in the far flung dystopina future, you are being guided around the planet Pandora by a mysterious static voice of a woman looking for an equally mysterious vault. That's all you need to know.

The rest of the game is simply, if it moves, kill it and collect the loot.

The game is simplistic and deep at the same time.  Amazingly the first 10 levels you play won't even take you that far from your startpoint as you learn how to choose your weapons, fight at least 3 bosses, learn how to drive vehicles and so forth.

Grphically speaking, the cel shading art is pretty good but sometimes I still longed for the 'realistic' approach given to Fallout.

Multiplayer handles pretty well with very little lag and sometimes battles can get hectic really quick.

If I can give any minuses to the game, it would be these.

Enemies that are MUCH lower in level to you can still wield a large amount of damage on you and even though you can be a level 10 character and kill a level 4 enemy with ease, that level 4 enemy can still deal large amounts of damage quickly and moreso in a swarm.

This is possibly the only major thing that unbalances the game.

The other is sometimes it takes a few button clicks to reload ( I think this is a skill thing) and sometimes you have to highlight a drop item 'just so' to pick it up.

The driving controls are a bit clunky and takes practice just to get it to go straight but hey, you didn't get this game to go driving!

My only other major issue is that I have as of yet not seen anyplace to store your loot and I am not sure of this was intentional or not but games of this sort always allowed you to have some type of storage system because you never know if that 'one' gun you found earlier may be needed later...however I am guessing that with the amount of stuff available you sell it more than keep.

We also as of yet not seen a way to swap weapons between players short of dropping it on the ground, hopefully this may be remedied later as by doing this mean you need to be playing with people you trust.

Now, the skill tree is the coolest and easiest I have seen to use.  You have to make sure you stick to whichever one you choose to flesh out and get the max skills for your character. I am using a Soldier and I am trying to max his skills out right now under the medic branch so he can be most effective in multiplayer.

H.,"There aren't many racing simulations out for the shooter focused XBox 360, so many racing sim fans are getting anxious for a new one to come out. Well, if you are one of those people and don't already have Forza 2, buy it immediately, because racing simulations don't get much better than this.

Graphics- 6/10. Cars in Forza 2 can look great, beautiful even. With real time damage, and a seemingly unlimited amount of customization to be done on the cars, it's a wonder how all of them look so dang polished. Forza 2 really captures all of the different cars superbly, and every single car is totally recognizable to its real life counterpart, right down to the shine of the paint.

So why give it a 6? Because everything besides the cars are a disappointment The race tracks themselves look O.K., but the grass and what not around them look awful, spectators are one step up from the old cardboard models used on the original XBox, plus the bumpers around the tracks use some really bad textures. Texture work in general is simply not very good on Forza 2. Particle effects aren't up to par, and in general, it is hard to call the graphics anything more than a major disappointment.

Sound- 4/10. Forza 2 features one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. The headliner of the songs is ""Gone Daddy Gone"" by Gnarls Barkley, which appeals to a certain audience, but most of the songs are electronic rock- wait, electronic rock? Huh? Besides the god awful soundtrack, quite a few of the cars sound suspiciously alike, though not so much that you won't be able to tell the difference from a Ferrari and a Honda. All crashes sound a lot alike, and, you guessed it, most of the skidding sounds you will make sound alike.

Forza 2 came out nearly 2 years ago, so the sub-par graphics are to be expected as the ever-changing visuals of the XBox 360 continue to improve. Don't get to discouraged by the bad soundtrack and visuals, because Forza 2 has just so much more to offer in the rest of the game.

Customization- 10/10. This is where Forza 2 really shines, or doesn't shine; it depends on how you play the game. You can upgrade your cars in career mode in a vast array of different ways, though none of it is necessary to win a race, on any level of difficulty. It will make it easier to win, sure, but you can get by on just the standard cars that you can buy, if you aren't the type of player that like to tweak out your ride. If you do want to upgrade you cars, it breaks down to four ways in which you can do this. The first is Engine and Power- Intake and exhaust upgrades reduce restrictions on airflow into and exhaust flow out of the engine. Fuel and ignition upgrades increase fuel flow and provide a hotter spark for more efficient combustion. Turbo and supercharger upgrades force more air in the engine. You can also perform a complete engine swap. Next, there is the Platform and Handling upgrades- by upgrading your car's suspension to lighten and stiffen the chassis, you can improve its handling. Upgrading the suspension, brakes, and transmission, and driveline improve the car's response to driver input. Also, you can upgrade the Tires and Rims- The stock tires on your car limit your track performance, no matter how you tweak you engine or suspension. Upgrading rims and tire compound, size, and profile improves acceleration, cornering, and brake performance. Finally, you can upgrade the Weight and Aerodynamics- Upgrading body components (bumpers, wings, skirts, spoilers, hoods, and so on) can lighten the care, reduce aerodynamic drag, and improve grip by increasing down force. You can also customize a car's appearance to make it your car. There are also three levels of upgrades to choose from- Street, sport, and race upgrades. Street upgrades provide a mild performance increase at a low cost, Sport upgrades provide a medium performance increase at a moderate price, and Race upgrades provide a major performance increase, but come at a major cost. To upgrade cars, you need ""credits"" that you earn by winning races, but some upgrades will change the class of your car, which can be bad, as the other cars in your new class might be better than your car, making you uncompetitive. The most fun of these upgrades in my opinion, is changing your car's appearance, as there is just so many ways to do this. You might put a decal on the car, change the paint, give it a new spoiler, add vinyl, and so on. You can also use layers to create a custom design, which is complicated to perform, but makes your car awesome. You can gift your custom cars to your friends at any time, so you can have a team design while you race online, or just to show off your new car. I really have found no faults at all in the customization part of Forza 2. The slogan ""Fuel your Fantasy"" fits this game perfectly, as if you can think it up, you can drive.

Options- 8/10. There is a seemingly unlimited amount of different cars to drive in Forza 2. Over 300 different cars, with 10 different classes from 9 different countries become available to you in the game over time, and it never gets old to rip around the track in a brand new Lamborghini. However, the tracks you are ripping around in do get old, as there are only 12 different environments that are separated into only different tracks. Some of the tracks you will know, like Silverstone, and there are a few good fantasy tracks to race on. There is quite a few different modes to play in, including Arcade, Career, and Multiplayer.

Gameplay- 7/10. Beware; this game has one of the biggest learning curves you will ever have to deal with. No matter what car you are racing with, you WILL crash on your first big turn. You have to crawl around each corner at like 40 miles per hour in your super car, which can be very frustrating. However, it is a racing simulation, so the game is going for reality over fun, and it most definitely is the most realistic racing game you will play this year. Every car takes real-time damage, and you really get into the race when you get side-swiped in your 200,000 dollar car. The A.I. certainly could be better, but they usually won't do anything that will cost them the race.

After you spend an hour or two destroying your cars, you should get the general idea of how to play Forza 2. It comes down to just going slower that you thought you would have to, and the game actually becomes quite un-challenging to play after you get the hang of it. You probably won't do races more than once or twice, and eventually, the monotony of the game could get to you if you aren't really into the options and customization part of the game. The reason you'd want to buy this game is to drive really, really expensive cars that you won't see in real life, if you want to just have a blast driving around, this game is not for you.

Career- 8/10. The career mode serves it's purpose- to expose you to the vast amount of cars and customization to be done with those cars. There is no real story involved in the game, other than the goal of winning all of you races to be the best driver you can be. The cars you get, and ultimately the amount of fun you will have comes down to which country you pick to be from, as all the cars that you can buy at a discount in the early stages of the career mode revolve around this choice. A nice touch is that the career mode can be played online with other human drivers, to gain credits to buy new cars and customize them. You'll spend most of your time in Career while playing Forza 2, and with the amount different options you have while in it (as previously stated), it's no wonder why this is one of the elite racing games for the XBox 360. This gets an 8 from me, because as with everything in Forza 2, things can get boring if you aren't a real car enthusiast, and this mode will certainly not be fun for everyone.

Multiplayer/XBox Live- 9/10. Multiplayer has a little something to offer everyone in Forza Motorsport 2. You can race players on a split screen, use a system link to connect up to eight XBox 360s on a LAN, or play one of the varies modes over XBox Live. While in XBox Live, you can participate in the standard Exhibition race, play in a Tournament, Gift a Car to a friend, buy or sell a car over the online auction house, or even watch Forza Motorsport TV. The Exhibition race is self explanatory- race against 8 other players, whether they be random, or your friends. The tournament mode is great fun, and the basic synopsis is as follows- Players race in groups of eight based on qualifying times. The top four in each group advance to the next round until a driver wins. For each completed round, you win credits, which you can apply later in the career. The auction house is my favorite part of Forza 2, as you can essentially trade a car in that you no longer want for a car you are just dying to have. Things work just like you might expect, you search the data base for the car you want, place a bid, and if you have the highest bid when things are said and done, the car is yours. You can also start an auction as so people will bid on your car. Forza TV is an interesting concept, which probably looked better on paper than it does in the game. Forza Motorsport TV has multiple channels that allow you to watch the ""hottest action"", and give you updates to what's going on in the world of Forza. They pick which races are broadcasted by the racers ranks, so unless you are one of the top players in the world, you probably won't be on the network. I guess it turns out that it is more fun to play video games than to watch them. Go figure. In summary, the multiplayer is great fun, and will always give you something to do.

Forza 2 is the epitome of realism in a game. If you want to feel what it is like to drive the world's finest cars, you will have a blast with this game. If you want to just have a good time racing around, this game is not for you. If that is the case, I'd recommend Burnout: Paradise, it is much easier to just pick up and play. If you're up for the challenge, and love cars, go ahead and stop reading my review, drive to the store, and buy this game. If you aren't so sure, it is at least worth playing at a friends or renting, to see if you can get into it. I'm going to give it a 8.9/10, making Forza 2 the best racing game for the XBox 360 in my opinion.",Put a pedal to the metal with Forza Motorsport 2...,1211587200,,,

Flynn is a old friend of the main character Yuri who prefers to try to go after evil officials by using the law, while Yuri is frustrated at waiting to get evidence or a warrant and will rush in to stop them, often illegally.  The game raises an interesting question; how do we deal with criminals who are powerful enough to evade punishment through the law?

The game begins with the same character in the original game who is now a mercenary that has decided to give up the force.  As the levels progress, your character becomes entangled in a web of Jedi conspiracies and once again picks up his lightsaber to battle the bad guys.
One difference between this and the original game is that all force powers are available for your character.  In the first game, you choose your destiny and which side of the force you want to pursue as some powers are only available with evil Jedis and vice versa for good Jedis.  In JK2, all Jedi powers shown in the movies are available to your character which probably doesnt keep with the Star Wars storyline but makes for a more enjoyable game.
The graphics and sound in JK2 are on par with the times but not spectacular.  One of the biggest disappointments to me were the small movies in-between levels which I felt had poor graphics especially when compared to the first game which had real life actors play the parts.  One element many first person shooter (FPS) fans pay attention to is the AI of computer controlled opponents.  JK2s AI is decent but nothing special.  The  Jedi opponents are rather stupid but still fun to play against, and the game does a good job of making the Jedis smarter and stronger as the game goes on.  Sometimes the game allows you to sneak up on Stormtroopers and other enemies but overall the enemies don't have much personality.
Its hard to give JK2 a fair review because I love the movies and get a kick out of any game that allows me to wield a lightsaber.  All things being equal, its one of the better FPS games available at the moment but probably not the best.  You will enjoy your time with this game but it probably won't be your all-time favorite.
ACTION FANS   5 STARS  Regardless of how much you enjoy the Star Wars universe, this is a quality FPS and will eat up time.  That being said, gamers will probably cherish JK2 more if they love watching the Star Wars movies.  Because the game uses force powers in addition to weapons, it would be wise to own a mouse with several buttons and a scroller if youd like to avoid pressing a lot of keys.
STRATEGY FANS   2 STARS   Some of the press releases for JK2 stated that more strategy would be required for the sequel.  The strategies though aren't really antyhing more though than typical FPS puzzles: push the right buttons, find secret areas, match the right keys, etc.  Strict strategy lovers probably won't find much in JK2.
ADVENTURE/RPG FANS  3 STARS  There are some elements of an RPG in JK2 as your force powers progressively increase and the storyline is entertaining.  Its still a FPS game though and if you don't enjoy these types of games, you probably shouldnt give it a try unless you are a Star Wars fan.
X FACTOR  A HISTORY OF POOR STAR WARS PC GAMES - 5 STARS  There have been a few quality PC games based on Star Wars like the X-Wing series and the original JK.  Unfortunately, they were released several years ago.  Jedi Knight II is probably the first PC game in some time to capture the magic of the famous films it is based on.  Nothing beats a game that lets you control a fighting Jedi to the sound of John Williams classic score.
BUGS   4 STARS  Relatively bug free.  I experienced a few crashes, mostly in the multi-player mode but not enough to take away from my enjoyment of the game.
REPLAY VALUE   4 STARS  If you compare Jedi Knight II to other PC games, it has great replay value, mainly because its a FPS game which usually entails a fun online multiplayer mode and a healthy community of gamers ready to make custom files for the game.  Because of a large Star Wars fan following, Jedi Knight II already has an impressive amount of MODs, skins and other custom files available for download on the web at various fan sites.  Also, JK2 uses the Quake engine which many gamers are familiar with so the game promises to have a healthy amount of custom maps released in the near future even without an official editor.  One problem I had with JK2s multiplayer mode was that the maps for multi-player aren't as fun as other games Ive played.  Deathmatches and capture the flag are classic styles of play for FPS games (both are in JK2) but they have gotten boring as more games are released with objective maps. To me, deathmatches don't stand up to objective maps (maps that have specific goals each team much complete before the game is over) for replay value. Probably the most enjoyable type of game included in JK2 is the duel match.  On these maps, players battle each other one-on-one and the winner remains to face the next person in line.  It can be tedious waiting for your chance to play but they are the perfect types of matches for a game like JK2 that relies on lightsabers.  The maps are fun, the weapons and force powers make for enjoyable hours regardless of which type of game is played, but to me, something is missing in JK2s multiplayer.  Judging by the amount of MODs and other files already released by gamers in JK2s first month of release, there should be plenty of free extras available for download in the near future which will keep the game enjoyable.",The closest you can get to being an actual Jedi Knight...,1018742400,14,,

You can switch between guns and melee with ease to suit any situation, and auto-aiming ensures that locking on isn't an issue. In a comical fashion, weaker enemies will have their heads pop into the air when shot. Melee combat is quite brutal with a decent variety of weapons; pipes, swords, and daggers, even a sledgehammer. On the ranged side you have snipers, shotguns, and automatics, and RPGs.

Unfortunately, the game suffers from several problems, the worst of which is an inconsistent framerate. Also most of the guns sound the same and not particularly powerful  although their effect on the enemy is quite the opposite; strangely, in the enemys hands they sound much better.  On the upside, the voice acting is pretty good on the whole, even with Ivans has a cheesy Russian accent.

Visually, some of the environments look pretty good, apart from the odd low resolution texture. The characters also have great detailing; Ivans tattoos, for example. The overall looks aren't stellar for a Wii U game, especially when compared to Bayonetta 2.

Also you aren't bombared with moves. You learn a few at at time and once those are mastered you learn more throughout the game.

The graphics are ok,to me the game seemed kind of dark but this is Godzilla and it didn't look bad just a little boring. Being able to choose which character you want to play as is also nice. It gives you a chance to try out different moves and decide who you play best as or change things up a bit and play as a different character. The game is not so hard you want to give up but not so easy you can do it with your eyes closed. I think they found a nice medium in play that will keep you interested enough to want to finish the game.

One thing I did not like was some the repetition coming from air command or whoever is giving orders. If you don't do what they want you to do they will endlessly repeat it. Like kill whoever over and over can be annoying.

I've bought every one the day they've come out and I've loved every minute playing them.  I thought that Vice City was the best we could get, and I was almost certain of it.  And then San Andreas came along and my jaw dropped.  It is such an improvement.

The map in its entirety is HUGE (and that's an understatement).  Once it is all unlocked you can spend a looonnnnnggggggg time driving around the map in a complete circle on the highways.

You can change your clothing, pimp out your cars with nitro, hydraulics, etc.  The gameplay is just incredible, and the storyline is just like every other Grand Theft Auto, full of twists and complete mayhem.

I have never read the books and I am about half way through the first season of the HBO series. So before playing the game for the first time I was aware of some characters, locations and lore but not much.

Gameplay:
As many have stated this game plays like what Dragon Age 2 should have played like. Some people have called the fighting boring, I would have to disagree. The combat is fun and rewards tactics. (IF you don't play of easy, which I assume you can just press the attack button a few times and wait for your foes to die) Much like Dragon Age 2, Combat at the start of the game is a little boring since you have yet to unlock skills and executions but by the middle of the game when hordes are crashing down on you it's rewarding to strategize a battle plan and not simply button mash your opponents into oblivion. (Hint: Make sure to utilize your dog as much as possible later in the game and on harder settings. The dog has saved me from the load screen on many occasions.)

Apart from the actual combat the rest of the gameplay is like your other RPGS. Exploring areas results in hidden compartments of cash and loot. There is not a lot of loot but it is worth searching around. Also searching with your dog lets you find loot that otherwise wouldn't not be available to simply pick up. (I didn't figure that out until about chapter 6 or I'm sure I would have found even more loot.  An Example, there may be a fire pit that you have checked out with your character, if you switch to your dog and search the same fire pit all of a sudden there is a nice sword in there for you)

The Real Gem of the Game of Thrones is simple the story. (People complaining about the story have obviously not made it past chapter 4 of the game.)  Like I mentioned before I'm not a huge fan of the series. (Well at least before I started this game) The Story for both characters is great, Better than most RPG's to come out recently. Kingdoms of Amular's story can't compare to Game of Thrones Lore. Not to mention the twists that I don't want to give away. Just make sure that you pay attention because much like the TV show there is a lot of dialogue to listen to.

Graphics...

While they are far from the best in the world; people comparing this game to PS2 graphics are simply spoiled whiners who don't remember the PS2. These graphics are not the best, but they do the job. The armor's look great but everything else you have seen before this generation.

Bottom Line:

The story makes you want to experience more of the Lore. I actually ordered the first book today so I can get started on catching up with the rest of you. The combat being compared to Dragon age is a fair comparison. ( I Beat Dragon Age Origins 7 times so I may be a little biased in exclaiming that I really like the combat of this game)  The leveling system is fun and gives players a feeling of being unique while really not giving players a ton of customization options. I hope if they make a new game players can customize their character a little more. All and all Fun Game with a decent amount of gameplay. A little replay value as decisions you made the first time can be changed on a second play through. If you found this game for $40 bucks you are getting a good game at a great price. At $50 you are getting a solid game worth the money at $60 bucks you are supporting the video game industry and doing your part to help them balance their own budgets.

4.0,True,"11 18, 2014",AIRNP7NNWG7N4,B005LUUWL6,David H.,"I'm not going to lie, I bought this for Pokemon. I played Red and Yellow when they first came out and I played the card game and had Charizard holographic (shinies now, apparently). I remember some of my fondest moments were encountering MissingNo and Togepi and Mew. Then, I stopped. I don't remember why, but I just moved on. Until a few months ago. Then I traded my XBox 360 in for a 3DS XL and Pokemon. I couldn't believe how much had changed yet It was still so much the same and so much fun.

After a playthrough, I started reading more about it. I found out that Mew is virtually unobtainable! I was so annoyed. I had played the very first game, and because I hadn't bought each subsequent generation and traded my Mew from game to game I would never be able to get one. Same with a lot of other Pokemon! I was livid.

So I bought a copy of Pokemon White and plugged in my Action Replay. It... didn't work. Datel has been horribly lazy with the software that makes this work. I'm on a Mac, and they cancelled their Code Manager for Mac, even though that's what is advertised on the AR packaging (see the small coloured circles in the top left of the window?). No matter, I had Boot Camp and Parallels. Uhoh! Even Windows doesn't like Windows software. Nothing would work. I spent a good hour a day for a few days trying to figure it out. After all, the software installed fine, it just wouldn't connect to the hardware.

After much struggling and lots of Googling, the problem is that Datel doesn't have their driver signed for 64-bit. Windows won't tell you this when Code Manager installs, so you can go mad over why it isn't working. Booting up with a special flag lets Windows run with unsigned drivers. Finally!

After that, I had a steep learning curve and Datel's Code Manager software isn't the best, but it works. The device doesn't sync/merge sorted codes automatically and you have to drag and drop new codes (I could only replace the entire list, not code by code) and then commit them to the AR. I should note that since I fixed the driver issue and run Windows with unsigned drivers, the software has worked great. It was just set up that really vexed me.

As for the hardware, the AR looks a little bit bulging. Like a battery is expanding inside. It doesn't stop it working, or from fitting my 3DS XL. Just a bit odd. The fit and finish certainly have room to improve.

When in my 3DS, there are a few occasions where the DS doesn't recognize the Action Replay. Taking it out and putting it in usually solves this, but I something's blow on the cartridge. Hey, it's Nintendo, right? As with any memory editing hardware/software, this is prone to crashing your DS. Bad codes are the usual culprit, but Pokegen allows you to set activation keys, letting you choose what buttons will activate the cheat. Other times, it could be many things like if the DS runs dynamic memory allocation, the game may be in a different location in memory than the AR was expecting. And you'll crash. I always reboot the DS before doing anything with my AR and I've seen very little in crashes since I sorted the codes out and started properly rebooting.

While the AR has let me live my dream again, it's not without flaws. It is flimsy and a bit finicky. Support is non-existent for the software, and I'd expect the hardware, too. They know the 64-bit drivers are unsigned and would rather let their users work with it that get the drivers signed. It's a common problem with an easy solution. I wouldn't rely on Datel for support. Canceling a Mac version that they advertise on their products isn't very nice, especially when it looked pretty much done. I wouldn't count on Datel being in this space very long, either. As Nintendo gets more multiplayer and competitive, they are going to start working much harder to shut down cheating like this. They've already done a good enough job that there are no Action Replays for 3DS games (Powersaves doesn't count and doesn't run on the console).

But, this product still works. It's pretty cheap, too. Though it feels cheap, also, it does give a huge amount of control to the user. I give it 4 stars because of the software set up. It was infuriating and when I figured it out, I couldn't believe it was something so trivial.","Action Replay works fine, but don't count on Datel",1416268800,,,

#1 this remote does work to power off your ps3. Since it includes the ps button alike the ps3 controller you can hold it and get the same options as on the controller, turn the remote or system off.

#2 the remote doesn't drain your batteries more than any other bluetooth device, you can turn it off to save power as stated above - turning it on is as simple as pressing any button for 1-2 seconds.

#3 the battery cover doesn't fall off as you claimed if operated with some common sense (i.e.: don't rub it against your pants, sofa etc) - it's pretty secure actually.

#4 this remote is bluetooth people and not IR capable - why don't you do your research and find out what bluetooth and IR mean, the fact that they are totally different technologies, thus this will never be compatible with an IR receiver, no bluetooth device will actually be.

#5 The remote doesn't turn on your ps3 by accident if common sense is also involved. People claimed that it turned on their PS3s when they sat on it on the couch. Well people, the same happens with your IR remote if you sit on it. Most remotes turn on the TV if a channel button or the on/off button is pressed. Also, be more careful/respectful with your stuff and handle it with care... this was not made to sit on it or hit it against the wall!!!

The lack of illuminated buttons does not surprise me, not all remotes do. In fact few dedicated remotes do - this is not an universal remote!!!
Also, button and text size are not too small either, if you don't see them get some glasses.

The only gripe I have is that it doesn't give any feedback when it's in use (no LED nothing) but I can live with that. This remote complements the ps3 as a blu-ray player very well.

4.0,True,"03 7, 2012",AV6BQVVC1XE4E,B0064TYOLW,Eric L. Fletcher,"Hi all-

Saw a few people have had issues with the install.  This seems to be due to the buggy Origin service EA forces us to use (at least for me it was).  I had the demo and the required Origin service installed.  Yesterday, when my Amazon pre-order showed up, I installed from the DVD discs.  Or at least I tried to.  First, Origin forced a new version download for the service.  Then it would let me try.  Except the install did nothing.  It would get just past the ""select language"" prompt, and then do nothing.  Three times in a row.  Bleh.

""Off to the forums""  Hoooooooooooooooooooooly crap- tons of people having issues with the install.  Looks like we have been EA'ed again.

Problems from the install and post install stages, and lots around the downloaded version too.  After reading a few threads, I decided to hard reboot and then relaunch Origin and then try the install from the DVDs.  That seem to do the trick.  The install took a while, and I still haven't got my pre-order gun (m55 Argus), despite redeeming the code- Amazon makes it easy, EA makes it a pain.  It looks like its not a automatic process like Steam- I have to root around to get it.  Yay, its 2005 again!

The game itself is 5 stars for fun- if you like ME2, you will love this.  It found my ME2 Steam save just fine, which is a relief.  But the PC install process is problematic, and the Origin service is a buggy, poorly constructed and designed pile of ""horse manure"".

One annoyance- this clearly is a console title, and some of the controls reflect that (ex: just how many things are tied to the spacebar?)

So doing a hard reboot after Origin updates itself appears to be mandatory, even if Origin does not say so.  Hope this helps!

BTW- if you are on the fence on this, there is a pretty good demo version of the game to try out.","Great game, but problems with install and how I fixed them (hint- its Origin)",1331078400,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

While the Lego video games don't necessarily have the greatest level design, I can't deny the fact I find these games incredibly fun.  The fact that you can co-op through these games makes it all the more fun.

Indiana Jones was an excellent trilogy to bring in Lego format.  Though since they've progressed with this stuff... I kind of want to see a Lego Aliens/Predator series; I think that would be amazing!  Anyway, experiencing Indy in Lego format was great fun.  Basically if you've gone through the Lego Star Wars stuff then you already know the name of the game.  Playing the game in Story Mode can actually be pretty difficult, even for two people.  Once you're done that you get the chance to go through the game in Free Play, and for me, this is where the game really shines.  You get to use an array of different characters and you get to explore the maps for lost treasures and other hidden items.  I don't know what it is about doing this, but I find it incredibly fun.  I think the Lego games are a nice break from the usual fairly serious games I play like Half Life 2 or Mass Effect for example.

Some of the levels are a bit frustrating, but I've come to expect that when dealing with Lego developed games.  They also hide some of these items very well, so they are quite a challenge to find.  The hours of game play you get out of this makes it rather worthwhile in my opinion.

I really don't have much to say on this game other than if you've already got experience with Lego Star Wars, you know what to expect.  If this is your first Lego game, don't get too frustrated, they don't make the puzzles completely obvious.  In the end I had a lot of fun; however, I still wouldn't rank these types of games as the top games ever made.

4.0,True,"12 6, 2013",A35N8YJGV1IXLW,B00CRL9TU2,Dustin Wood,"Gran Turismo is one of my top games. I love racing games. From the days when I used to sit on my dads lap and watch him play Pole Position in the local arcade, I've been hooked on all sorts of racing games. Gran Turismo 1 for the PS1 was such a game changer with racing. Having been used to Need for Speed, it was unheard of when you had to use the brakes in a car game.

Gran Tursimo 6 continues the series. But it doesn't move it along very much. I did just get my copy in the mail about 3 hours ago. And I've put in around 2 hours of gameplay in it already. But for being the next game in sequential order, it just doesn't feel like that much of an upgrade.

They say they've redesigned the suspension and tires from the ground up. Most people probably won't even notice a difference. Graphics don't look any better than they did in GT5. There may be some slight differences in lighting. But really nothing stands out too much.

All the sound FX from all the previous games are still there. The bongs of the menus. The whiny pitch of the engines. And when you hit the walls or other cars, it still sounds like you just hit one of the large 55 gallon rubber barrels. I don't understand why they couldn't get a team to go out and collect realistic sounding noises.

The most disappointing part of the game is that you have to start all over from square one. Since this game already feels like GT4 and 5, I just wish you were able to carry over your progress. So instead, you have to start out on the very first track, again. Sunday Drive on the High Speed Ring. I feel like I've done this 5 times before.

The menu layout has been re-arranged. It doesn't really feel like an improvement, but it doesn't feel like its worse either. Its just re-arranged.

One of the things that GT6 has over GT5 is that you have access to all cars right away. Meaning, with GT5, if you wanted a Standard version of a car (ones that weren't re-done in HD,) you had to wait for it to show up in the used car selection of the game. Now, all those cars are listed under each of the new car's manufactures.

But I'm giving this game 4 stars because I feel I should judge this game for what it is now. And not comparing it to the previous versions. Although that's what most of my complaints are about here. But if you're new to the series, and this will be your first Gran Turismo game, its a fantastic racing game. As long as you don't assume its anywhere near what NFS is. Either you love games where it takes skill like Gran Turismo, or you just love games where you just feel like you always need to have the pedal to the metal like NFS.

Most likely you are reading this to see if its worth buying. It may be, if you're into having some of the newest cars, and some upgraded features. But if you're reading this to see if you'd be interested in Gran Turismo in general, I'd suggest that you buy Gran Turismo 5. For the price, you can't beat it. And if you're unfamiliar to the series, you most likely won't notice much difference between the two.

Hope this review has helped. Like I said, I'm only 2 hours into the game so far, so I don't have everything unlocked yet. Only just a couple slow cars. I'll update this review if I discover something new that I didn't touch on.

Oh, if you have the pre-order promo code, you have to enter the code inside the game. It will look invalid if you enter it in the PS3 dashboard, outside of the game.

***UPDATED*** (12/9/13)
So after spending the weekend playing GT6, my recommendation is to either buy or continue playing GT5. I have put several hours into the game, and I feel that I'd rather be putting that racing money towards the already large bank account I have in GT5.

AI is still very dumb. They don't race. They just drive in single file line, while following a very set path. They are sometimes aware of your location, but I've had the PIT maneuver done on me a few times in a corner. If this was a real race, I'd be getting of of my car, and throwing my helmet at your windshield the next lap.

But they might as well make the game only time trials. This racing game just doesn't seem like a racing game. You're only overtaking opponents one by one. But its been this way since GT1. For once I'd like to try to overtake 2 opponents who are battling between themselves.

ALL sounds are still all horrid. From the same menu SFX that have been in every single game, to the music that sounds like it belongs on the Nintendo, to the car sounds. I don't think that by putting racing exhaust on a 2014 Corvette would make it sound like a 6-cylinder import car. Chevy should be ashamed.

Cars still feel floaty when in the air. I believe the track is Trial Mountain. Its been slightly updated from the previous version. But the last corner has a slight raise against the wall. If you hit it, you'll get some air, but only from the two wheel that run over it. And it just felt the same as before. Like there was a pocket of air surrounding the car, which gently carried it across the track, and gently placed all 4 wheels back onto the ground. Updated suspension and aerodynamic models, my butt. And in reality, if I had actually hit that corner the same way in a real car, it probably would have flipped me over.

So since I did pay full price for this game, I've been trying to get the most out of it. And I've also tried to make it as realistic as possible. I still have my Logitech steering wheel from when I bought GT4. I've turned off all HUD items, and turned off the racing lines. I also drive from the cockpit view. So its as realistic as it can be.  Which BTW, cockpit view makes your screen DARK. Not sure why they feel that adding glass makes everything dark. With the nose cam view, the track is bright. In-car, dark. But the rear-view mirror is still bright.

***UPDATED*** (12/16/13)
Few more things. As a commenter point out, I realized I haven't tried online yet. Figured I'd get some better cars first, and learn the tracks with different setups before going online. Unlike others, I try to race without using other cars as brakes.

V-Sync seems to be more of an issue later on, when you're racing against more cars. I've noticed it quite a bit on the Matterhorn track. Its a new original track set in the mountains. It looks beautiful. But am getting v-sync ""tearing"" around almost every corner. It really doesn't affect gameplay, and frame rate seems to stay quick. But its kind of annoying. But for most people, you may not even notice it.

Night races not in the city are nearly impossible. I really don't want to mess with my TV's brightness settings, but I'm going to have to to be able to finish some races. There's a night race at Willow Springs, and I CANNOT see anything. The headlights don't light up the road, but they do light up the dirt when you run off track. Its near impossible to race like this. The only thing thats somewhat helped is to always stay behind a crowed, and watch the taillights. But even doing this, I finished 6th, and ran off the road several times. One good thing though was that I unlocked an achievement of staying in the air for a second after I hit a minor dirt hill.","Good game, just too similar to the previous ones.",1386288000,216,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

WARNING: Below is not a review for the product itself, just a comment. If not interested please leave.

I heard people criticizing the launch day DLC that costs extra $10 for the part that is necessary to complete the game plot. Well, I made similar negative comments about Star craft 2 that Blizzard is getting greedy. However, after I learned the story of Sierra, I'm kind of regret giving that comment.

Well, Sierra may not be a good example because it was most famous for publishing games, not developing. But look at those it published: Homeworld, Ground Control, Empire Earth, Half-life, Counter-Strike, FEAR, World in Conflict, etc. All sound too familiar, isn't it? At the time when people were stunned by the fabulous experience brought by Homeworld, who could tell Sierra would become history in 2008?

That's what's my mind: while social network, MMO and mobile platform games are making big money, some PC/console game developers may not be so lucky. Anyway, Gamers like us is not a big group comparing to the amount of users of facebook. I think the game developers need and deserve the financial support from their fans. Otherwise they may run out of business and in the end we Gamers will pay the price as we lose the opportunity to play well-made games. Think about it: if Bioware became history before releasing ME3, would you feel regretful?

Just to name it for an example: when you pay $14.99 to purchase gold coins in Cartoon wars just to purchase an upgrade or a weapon in order not to suck too much in this repetitive game, don't you feel only $10 bucks for a carefully plotted story is way more worthy?

I downloaded the demo and played for about three hours before deciding to go ahead and buy it.  My initial hesitation was that at first it can be a little boring just taking jobs for other people.  I didn't bother to buy my own truck while playing the demo so I didn't do the free drive feature or modify and paint any trucks.  All of these features and running your own trucking company really help open up gameplay.  Driving the highways, just like real life, can be long and boring; driving around cities and not taking damage or getting a ticket can be a challenge.  I haven't really started exploring on my own or managing other drivers but I'm looking forward to that.

I have noticed that if I use the mouse to ""turn my head"" inside the cab there is a brief stutter sometimes.

The physics feel pretty real to me.  The truck is much faster to accelerate and stop with no load.  I have almost tipped when going down an off ramp too fast.

A minor annoyance is that I'll turn on the lights, drive for awhile and a fine for driving light offense will pop up.  I'll look down and the lights are off and I have no idea why.  I also recommend a console controller or wheel set up.  Driving by keyboard can be problematic.  There is a good deal of repetiton and it's not as open world as I would like.  Each city is pretty much the same, just a small four or five block area with hotels, workshops, and depots to perform various tasks.  Don't expect to drive a big rig under the Arc De Triomphe in Grand Theft Auto style.

I don't know what it is about this game but friends I've discussed it with tease me and sometimes I play it up because on the surface it sounds like a boring concept.

=Pros=
+Graphics are indeed improved and more organic
+Gameplay mechanics are improved too; You can carry someone and still move with ease, and even sprint as an example
+Replacement for David Hayter as Snake is Kiefer Sutherland, and while he does not sound like Snake, does a good job overall as a voice-actor
+Audio Tapes in-game allow those who missed out on Peace Walker or forgotten important parts help catch you up to speed on the story, as well as Paz's Diary logs... oh, it also bothers to give a Backstory.
+Can actually play up to 10 tracks from your PS3 that's been downloaded and upload it to the in-game's music player, and it sounds better than on the PS3 itself! Kinda redundant on the Xbox though... but that quality sound....
+Side Ops are fun and bring just enough content to make this game worth $19.99
+Story does not appear to have gotten weaker, but stronger (spoiler: there's 2 tragedies that made me sad...)

=Cons=
-Incredibly short; Why are we given so little amount of content for $30? Why not just wait to release the full-game?! We have patience!
-Story left more questions than answers
-Side Ops don't contribute to the story at all
-Kiefer Sutherland is still not David Hayter though.... :-(

I have mixed feelings for this title. If Hideo Kojima was just giving us a part of the game to hold us over until the grand release, then I can thank him for that. But if this was just a cheap marketing ploy to make us pay extra for a portion of the game, then I feel ripped off.

Your best bet is to either wait until the price drop goes down to $20, or you can go and rent it at a Redbox or something (as of today, anyway). The game is great, but it's too short and feels kind of... well, you know what I feel about it. I just hope Phantom Pain will be worth it...
...which I do have hopes for, since, for example, the timeline in Ground Zeroes is only a year after Peace Walker, and Phantom Pain's timeline is in 1984, 11 years before the original Metal Gear.

Please, I have faith in you, Kojima. While I felt like I gotten DLC, it's still good. Make me proud with Phantom Pain... I know you can do it.

Out of sheer ignorance, I didn't realize that Hideo Kojima did in fact plan to give us something to hold the fans over until the big one comes out.

I  personally have a background of mudding on hack-n-slash CircleMUDs, and so  I found the game format very natural, but people who are looking for more  storyline elements and character development are going to be disappointed,  as in the end this game is about killing monsters and getting gold. There  are some okay puzzle elements to the game, but the system is fairly  limited.
One other tangential point to this game is that it has a _very_  good soundtrack. As the levels get higher, the music gets better. In  particular, the music for the secret level Mausoleum (at the end of the  Castle Treasury level) is stellar.
In short, this is game provides for a  lot of fun, and can be fun for quite a while if you're looking for a  mindless timewaster (which certainly has its place), but for actually  wanting challenges and real goals, the game ends up falling off a bit too  soon. If you have friends to play with you, I highly recommend buying it,  but otherwise, I'd try it out first.","Fun, but brief",965001600,10,,

Many people who saw the movie were dissapointed because it was much worse than the first one. But, the game somewhat makes up for it. First off, I realize that many reviews from magazines and such have not been giving this game great reviews. This is because there are a lot of technical difficulties with this game, including it being short, having graphical problems, controls being fustrating at times, and there are a few glitches in gameplay. However, this game is great nonetheless.
Enter the Matrix is a fun-filled action game with a lot of replay value (there are two different characters you could play as). This game is purely action. Between driving cars and ships, shooting from turrets and cars, shooting with guns on the ground, and just plain awesome fighting, this game has a variety of different gameplay. It also has a fantastic story line if you like The Matrix series because it fills in many gaps in The Matrix Reloaded.

First off, the worlds are huge. There are lots to explore and discover in these maps. I found myself constantly checking the maps to make sure I explored all the areas I could. Granted you don't have to, but the little extra's always seem to be in a room that's off the beaten path, and easily hidden.

Although I had gotten used to the great new gameplay mechanics of MGS5, this game really impressed me when it came to its story and action sequences (something that we all know MGS5 sorely lacked). The whole idea of having Solid Snake prematurely age and integrating that into the gameplay and narrative shows the true genius of Hideo Kojima.

You are Captin Renko, part of a team scrambled to see what's going on with an abandoned Soviet Research station that appears to have a malfunctioning nuclear reactor that has suddenly become active.  Upon you arrival you find that the base appears to have been completley abandoned with no signs of life.  Suddenly there is EMP blast that knocks your copter out of the sky.  When you wake up you find yourself seperated from your squad on the other side of the island.

As you make your way toward your squad commander you encounter strange visions and find mysterious notes that indicate that the researchers there had discovered a new type of element that promised to unlock a source of unlimited power. Suddenly you hear another explosin and look up... only to find your self in a burning building.  On your way out of the building you come across a wounded scientist, doing the right thing you pick up the scientest and carry him out of the building to safety. Then you look around again and find your self back in the ruined building you just left.

The only thing you don't know is that you just changed history.  The world is now ruled by the Soviet Union and they want to know why there is two U.S, which hasn't existed for 40 years as far as they know, soldiers snooping around one of their abandonded bases.  An unexpected ally rescues you from the Soviet forces and tells you that your the cause and the solution to the new time line and tells you that you must find a device called the TMD if you want any chance at putting the timeline back to the way it was.  Little do you know that the ripples you caused by changing the time line go further and deeper than you ever imagined...

--------------------------------------------
Time Played: About 10 hrs

Graphics: Great

Control: I didn't notice any real problems. There are some segements where the aiming can be a little clunky when the screen is shaking all over the place. Only real issue I had is a level later in the game where you have to keep the targeting reticule over a critter to knock it off a train with a energy beam.  I know what they were going for but it was still super annoying.

Gameplay: Different. It never got old turning enemies into to dust or playing around with the time abilites.

Story: The concept is different, the setup is great, the clues scattered throughout the levels keep you guessing at what is going on and then at the end... your given three ending that don't really go anywhere with what you have found out.  Personally it would have been nice if they had added another ending or two that let the player think their way out of the coundrum their given at the end of the game.  But other than that it was defenitely worth playing to the end to see what happened.

I would recommend this to anyone who liked the bioshock games, mass effect, or any other shooters that have a interesting story to go along with their gunplay. m.a.c","How can you set the past right, when your what's wrong?",1300838400,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

At the time the cheapest new copy of the game I could get was $70, so I was expecting much more from the game.

However, a few months ago, after finishing Ghost Trick, I decided to give Radiant Historia another chance. And now here I am, a little over a year and a quarter from when I first picked the game up, writing a review, having just finished it a few hours ago.

I don't exactly recall what caused me to put the game down, but having now gone through the game I think it may just been the wrong time for me, as both the story and music - two of the major reasons I typically enjoy RPGs over all other genres - are pretty dang good.

The musical score at times reminds me of Final Fantasy VI, Nier, and Lost Odyssey. The branching storyline reminds me of Chrono Trigger (albeit it's definitely not as complex). The character art reminds me of Blue Dragon (or maybe just Raynie reminds me strongly of Zola).

The gameplay is perhaps the one slightly insignificant aspect, as while it does feature some complexity when it comes to moving the location of enemies on the 3x3 grid they inhabit, I found myself using 4 characters (including the main one who can't be swapped out) for most of the endgame, depending upon who I had access to in the storyline.

In short, I found the game to be really quite good, once I was able to really get into it. However, I'm not sure how much of the 40+ hours I put into the game will stick with me down the road, especially given the fairly safe ending.

I give Radiant Historia 4 of 5 stars, primarily because of the great music and story/mission structure.",Fantastic music and interesting branching story,1401408000,2,,
4.0,False,"11 30, 2011",AVGZZIUZWPE67,B002MED6F8,Jaron,"I tend to find linear driving/racing games extremely boring.  It's just the way I am.  But I LOVE open world games and open world driving games are no exception.  The thought of being able to go wherever you want-left, right, North, South-in a video game simulation is just such a thrilling idea.  MCLA is all that and soo much more.  I originally bought this game because I just wanted to cruise around in fancy cars like in GTAIV.  I, however, HATED the way the cars in GTAIV handled.  Luckily with MCLA you get the great handling that GTA lacked and a fantastic variety of cars and bikes.  Not only is there millions of ways to customize vehicles but the racing is superb.  Granted the racing can tend to be on the harder side, but THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT!!  Who wants to race with AI's that are way too easy or dumb!  With the patch the AI's are not impossible to beat and they give a real sense of competitiveness like in the real world.  They drive hard enough to satisfy my competitive edge, but also aren't lacking in the ability to fail like crashing into other cars.  People that reviewed this game tend to say that the AI's are too hard even with the patch, but for me it's just fine because I really do not get bored re-racing.  By re-racing your opponent, you will get much better at driving and beating the AI's gets easier.  Trust me, the driving experience itself is just plain fun!

Some features I love in the game:

Weight Distribution-This is one of my favorite things about this game.  This allows you to tilt your car to one side and drive on two wheels.  For motorcycles you will drift.  This allows for much tighter turns without losing much speed.  Very fun to play with!

Car Customization:  This can be a con for me because I am an indecisive person.  There are just so many ways to customize your cars that I have a hard time deciding exactly what I like and takes up a lot of my time.  For example, the rim of your wheels can have 3 or 4 different areas to modify your color!

Cruising on Xbox live-this allows you to really practice driving or race with friends without the hinderances of traffic.  There are no cars on the road and you can pretty much do most if not all your achievments (like 15 miles of wheelies with your bike).

Graphics-although the graphics are not as good as Driver SF, it's still pretty fantastic.  Nights and days are just beautiful to play in.

Controller setup-Yes, there is the ability to choose manual or auto.  Unlike a lot of xbox games I've played, you can setup each button on your controller to whatever function you want.  This is great especially because I tend to have a feel for buttons at certain areas only.  I like to have my shifters on the bumper buttons but you can even set your right analog stick to shift up and down kind of like a real manual shifter in a car.

Features that I wish they added:

Map GPS:

Finding the best route is hard especially during a race.  It's hard enough to keep track of the road but you also really have to keep an eye on the map.  If Rockstar implemented a customizable highlighted route, this game would be perfect.  Before starting a race we should be able to highlight the routes (shortcuts included) because it can be annoying to have to frequently look at the map.

Better car selection:

I really like a lot of the cars on MCLA.  But this game can do without cars like Chevy Impalas.  Does anyone really dream about racing with one of these??  Ford, BMWs, Toyotas, and Hondas would have been nice.

After reading reviews I bought three of what I thought were the top open world driving games for the Xbox 360.  Burnout Paradise, then Midnight Club Los Angeles, then finally I bought Driver SF over the black Friday sale.  MCLA is definitely my favorite.  To keep things short, I like MCLA because it really provides a realistic open world driving experience (aside from being able to tilt your car) for the competitive driving we all are pretty much not able to do in the real world.  Cruising is also really fun.  Burnout Paradise provides more of a toon style of game play since its mostly about crashes and jumps.  You also don't get the cockpit view which I don't like.  Driver SF is beautiful to play in, however, I don't really like the driving mechanics as much as MCLA.  You tend to burnout a little too easily in the game.  Also the car diversity is pretty bad in that game.

In my opinion MCLA is the best open world driving game for realistic game play and superb car dynamics.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I really wish they would add the GPS highlighting system.

Half-Life 2 is a high quality FPS with a cool single player campaign.  Since this game truly is awesome, I'll leave it at that and focus on the minor annoyances you may find in the game.

Biggest annoyance:

Steam.  Valve uses the steam program to validate your cd key, take up resources, advertise, take over the world, etc.  I have no problem with registering my game, but this forced registration of my legit game had me a little annoyed.  I was excited when the installation was finally coming to an end, but when i tried to validate my cd key, Steam said that the servers were unable to do it at that time.  I had to wait like an  hour.  Trust me, that's not cool when you're all excited about the game you just bought and want to play it RIGHT NOW.

Other minor problems:

When walking, you get stuck on the props and sometimes have to load a saved game simply because you can't walk or jump away.

5.1 sound does not work on many sound cards.  And if it does work, it can cause the game to ""studder"" quite often.

Lots of jumping from one platform to another.  Is this Mario?

Very very linear.  Holy cow, I feel like I'm in a rat maze.  Good thing the graphics are beautiful enough to distract me.

In the sixth level, enemies keep spawning from nowhere.  I like to be able to clear an area and have it stay clear so I can turn my back on it.

Those are my complaints about this game.  To list every good thing about the game, however, I would need lots more space.  This is a great game for what it is, and I am happy I bought it.  The collectors edition DVD makes installing so much easier too.  Plus you get a cool shirt and a crappy little Half-Life 2 book that you'll never open.

Overall I liked the game, although driving the car left a lot to be desired.  Other reviewers say that the gameplay is repetitive, but once you get further into the game you start R&D to develop new weapons which are needed to beat certain higher levels.  I love the theme song, but it's the only song in the game.  Some additional music would have been appreciated.

I am going to get the Wii version for the better graphics.  However if you like the Ghostbusters and want to take it with you, I think that this game will give you some variety when you get bored playing Mario Cart for the 1000th time.  I want to give this game 5 stars, but the driving experience is holding me back.  There are other cars on the road which are controlled by poor AI, along with a convoluted steet layout, and a bad attempt at a GPS system.

4.0,True,"09 12, 2013",AX8OVRMMVWB8Y,B00BRQN2EM,Jim D,"I was a little apprehensive when I heard that super powers would be a part of this game, but they really fit in with the goofy feeling of the game.  It also changes up the game quite a bit.  Once you get the super running (early on in the game), cars become practically useless.  Super jumping/gliding (also fairly early in the game) eliminate much of the need for aircraft.  It's still fun to steal a flying saucer and cause havoc in the streets, though.

Gameplay itself, for the most part, is similar to SR3.  Grenades are gone (replaced on the gamepad by superpowers).  In this installment, you can customize various aspects of your weapons (not just upgrade them in general, but upgrade damage, recoil, area of effect, etc).  Unfortunately, these upgrades don't change the way the weapons look, as they did in the previous game.  You can customize the look of most of the weapons, but it generally amounts to only a color change.  Money is fairly easy to  come by - not enough to upgrade everything all at once, but it's easy enough that you don't feel like you've started a part-time job just to keep yourself supplied with ammo.

One gripe I had about this game is the way the missions are set up.  While most of the main missions are unique, a lot of the side missions have you running around town completing various activities.  It almost seems like filler sometimes (a point that one of the mission titles actually pokes fun at later on in the game).  Racing (which I can't stand) seemed to come up repeatedly in the first half of the game.  One nice touch, however, is that if a side mission requires you to finish four specific activities on the map, and you've already completed two of those, you don't have to repeat them.  You could always skip the side missions, but then you'd miss out on a lot of really nice weapon, power, and homie upgrades.

Another  gripe I had was that the game seemed a little bit short.  I just finished my first play-through last night, and even with all the stop-and-go playing I did, it only took me 35 hours (spread out over about 3 weeks).  SR3 took me about 45 hours, another 10 for the DLC.  My next playthrough will be on the hardest level, so that might make things last longer.

The bugs in this game are jarring enough for me to take away a star.  Occasionally, your game will just lock.  There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason for it happening.  One time I was running around the ship, another time I was trying out my ""Death from above"" attack from the highest point in the game.  The game apparently compensates for this by saving about EVERY TEN SECONDS.  Whenever it saves, it's like the game skips a beat.  VERY annoying,.

All in all, if you liked the direction that the Saints Row games were taking, you'll want to pick this up.  The levelling is not a slog (but not too easy), and the gameplay is a lot of fun with the new superpowers.  If the series has to end, this was a great way for it to go out.","A fitting (and crazy) sequel, but a little buggy",1378944000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So just buy the ones that are made for the game system itself because they are just better.  Plus then you don't have to have a big fight every time it comes down to who's going to have to take the crappy controller.  It will save bloody noses and bad excuses from people who get beat every time anyhow.
On the other hand, R2 is the most ridiculous button ever made.  It's about as useless as Scroll lock button on your computer.  It's just not in the right place to be used well at all.  Sony needs to come up with some better idea for the position of that button.  Other than that the controller works well.

4.0,True,"04 3, 2010",A38DQCCC64K4W,B0013RATNM,takethekman,"I cannot say I have finished this game, but I have put some considerable time into it....at least enough to know this is one of the more entertaining sandbox games in some time; the ways you can navigate this huge world is amazing and allows you to be highly creative. Your grappling hook and parachute actually become some of your best weapons, whether pulling yourself out of an intense firefight just before you die or pulling a foe down from his tower to meet his demise; you actually kind of become a militant Spiderman in many ways.

The graphics are pretty amazing for a game of this scope; The weapon upgrades and helicopter assistance is nice, esp in traveling, which was a huge issue for the first game; the kill, chaos, and $ stats that pop up during your rampages is a pretty fun addition and gives it an arcade-like feel once you get on a roll. The gunplay can be intense at times, and the over the shoulder view can put you right in the middle.

So far the missions and exploring have not gotten old or repetitious; I could see how after 80 hours your could feel otherwise....I am at about 25-30 hours and am enjoying it a lot; the time flies by, and exploring is just as fun.....from the sea to the snow, there are some nice landscapes just to appreciate. Skydiving provides some awesome views, too....

The controls seems a little strange during the first tutorial missions, but once you get the feel of it, you will be slinging and shooting in no time. Never tires hijacking helicopters.

Bottom line is that this is a really well made and enjoyable sandbox game; Certainly a lot of bang for your buck, esp considering some games only give you 10-20 hours of play, unless they are are online of course too.

I don't know how well this would have worked online, but I am thankful the single player mode is as amazing as it is. If there was one complaint so far, it is just that this game is too big. So I guess it's a good complaint, esp nowadays where you want your video game $ going into something good and something that lasts or has high replay.

Sorry, but that's hilarious to me, not too long ago, 80 GB was a ""Bottomless Pit"" of storage...where are we GOING in terms of hard drive space? LOL)
But as for the system, I was on the fence for a long time whether to just wait. I got this for myself as a graduation present, and because I REALLY want to play Halo 5 when it comes out, as well as the new Star Wars Battlefront, and so many more games.
PROS: The White Console and controller look FANTASTIC, very clean and slick visually.
Halo Fanboy? Yes I am, and proud of it. Halo has NEVER looked better, and the Master Chief collection of Halo 1-4, PLUS some great extras are VERY worth it.
ALSO a ""PRO"" in my opinion...NO KINECT! Yes that's right, I hate kinect, I don't like talking to it, I don't like anything about it, and if I ever DO get one for a game or something, I'm covering the lens when not in use...Kinect is an invasion of privacy in my opinion.

Its a great mix of strategy and action. A very unique turn based system unlike any Ive seen. The game was addicting when I played it on the ps3.

As far as this version : The main bonus for me was getting the dlc episodes all included. These are nice missions that are not in the base game normally.  You will not notice much of a difference in the visual fidelity but the framerate is doubled to 60 fps. It doesnt really do much for the presentation for me, beyond how great the game already ran on ps3. This is not a twitch action game so 60 fps is less important here. The textures may be a little sharper but its very hard for me to notice and it plays much like I remember it on ps3. Its not going to change the experience enough to purchase on that reason alone. The game is based on hand drawn looking artwork in motion, and this looks just as amazing to me on the ps3.

Another huge reason to get this version over the Ps3 version is the loading times. It loads in SECONDS. Im referring to loading saves which is something you rapidly do in this game, unless you are a purist and refuse to do so. The game is built around saving constantly and reloading to try different tactics and can still be very hard at points.

I remember the loading taking fairly long in the Ps3 version. Since its something you do often you will be wasting alot of your time reloading in that version. I would say get this version for THAT reason alone. The extra polish and DLC is just a nice bonus.

If you have never played this amazing game then treat yourself to this game. I would have gladly paid 60 for this and gotten more than my money worth, when it came out on ps3.  To get this was 20 or less is such a value. This is one of those hidden games that blew me away when I played it.",AMAZING GAME.

I couldn't help being fascinated with the mechanics of the game and how you move around.  I loved the attention to detail in the levels and how you had to navigate.  Add to that the almost movie quality story line that makes you feel as though you are a part of the game and you already have a great game.  But it doesn't stop there because the graphics are so great I caught myself standing there changing the camera angle just so I could look at everything.  Standing atop the castle and looking out toward the monastery was just amazing.  Add to that the uniqueness of the game, such as the jet ski, and I came away impressed.

The only downside is that where you are getting 35+ hours of game play in most games you are only getting about 12.5 hours of game play in Uncharted, and I was exploring and searching everywhere.  If the game were longer I would have been extremely happy, but as is the game is still fantastic.  I can't imagine how they could improve at all on this game, but from what I hear Uncharted 2 is better!  Can't wait...

It starts out with Sonic in a helicopter being captured by a company called ""GUN"".  he escapes and flies down to, what looks like to me, San Francisco.  He snowboards...I mean streetboards down a hilly downtown road, on which he jumps off ramps and does tricks which are rated and given points.  He can also grind on rails, and do some new moves, like the somersault.  The best scene is at the end where he is running down a hilly street being chased by a semi with the ""GUN"" logo on it.  THis, I assume, is supposed to be the equivalent of the Killer Whale scene from Sonic Adventure, but I believe it is much better.

What is does is very simple. It takes the optical output and a USB port of your PS4, and converts it into plugs compatible with older headsets. This is required if PS4 does not already support your existing headset. However it will not work will devices. There is a compatibility list on the manufacturer site, which should be helpful in deciding whether you need and/or would benefit from this device. Also some older headsets already got PS4 support via updates, thus you should also check your headset's webpage to see whether there is current PS4 support.

How it works is also very simple. I tried debugging what it does with a Linux system, and it looks like it is a USB powered optical audio decoder, with a USB passthru port. I've done several tests, and the boldest one was attaching a flash drive to the USB port, which was detected fine on Linux. This means that the USB port is motly dummy. However optical to analog conversion is the one with the actual value (since there seems to be no direct analog output on the PS4 itself).

* Excellent graphics that defy realism
* You get to build your own ride from bottom up
* High-octane tricks that keep you on the edge of your seat

The bad:

* Controls can be sluggish and unresponsive at times
* Gets repetitive after a while

The Bottom Line:

This was the first video game that I can remember that gives you a ""Do Not Try This At Home"" fine print before you start playing it and no surprise as these tricks really look fun and makes you want to go out and do the same thing(please don't!)  You start off by building your ride, which will take you some time.  You get to pick every little minor details for your ride.  I'm not a mechanic-saavy, so even though I have no idea what a crocket or a fuel injector does, it cleverly explains to you and how does each part affects your vehicle's speed and handling.  After you are done, you are off to the races.  There are basically 3 types of races: Long Race, Short Race and Freestyle.  Freestyle race is fun, but regular races got a bit boring after a while, even after new tracks were unlocked.  Performing tricks can be tough.  If you are fraction of a second late on some tricks, you will find yourself crashing just like that.  Another annoyance occurs when you step out of bounds.  If you do that, you automatically crash, which makes you lose a lot of ground.  So while the point of the game is to make crazy tricks that earn you boost, I honestly think that if you drive careful and do not crash, you have a good chance of winning, which makes the whole point of tricks a tad dubious.  However, despite that, any fan of racing games or anyone with a passion for ATVs should definitely pick up this title and enjoy it.",PURE fun despite a couple of annoyances,1227139200,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

While many people complain that it is short (it is shorter than the previous games by Bioware) I personally found the length OK. Now granted I have a job and am going trough college, so games take me longer to finish. Its probably about 25-30 hrs in length depending on if you explore or not. Overall I'd say its a steal at the low price Amazon is currently selling it for. Its easily worth the full price for a PC game.

Now the only complaint is that it suffers from a few bugs, that the developer acknowledges, but has no plan on patching. The biggest issue is the camera occasionally getting stuck pointing straight down. On Vista it has a few crashes and reportedly some people have a hard time saving. The bright side is that the Vista issues seem to go away with the Windows 7 beta. Its a shame that they are not planning on fixing its few bugs.

5.0,False,"05 4, 2016",A3UIJ8LD1BE849,B014PZTAME,Jon,"FYI, I purchased this from Gamestop in November of 2015. My purchase was for the full $499 but it also came with a free game of my choice (I picked COD: BLOPS 3 and regretted it haha). Even at the full price, this was an amazing offer for the following reasons: 1. I really wanted the elite controller and it was sold out EVERYWHERE at the time. This bundle was even sold out most places. 2. If you subtracted the $150 price of the controller from the bundle I basically got a hybrid 1 TB console for $350 (which was a really sweet deal at the time, prices are lower right now). 3. It came with a free game of my choice. Do NOT pay full price for this bundle unless it comes with at least one game. As of the today, this bundle is $439 ($60 off or about the price of a new game), so make sure to get a good deal here. Not that the console isn't worth it without a good deal, just that at this point deals ARE out there and you should save or get free stuff whenever possible!

Now I will move on to the controller and then get to the console itself. The Elite controller is simply amazing. I love the weight (I don't get the odd hand fatigue some people talk about due to the heavier controller), I love the material (nice grip on it, and lots of metal components), and the premium look/feel this all attributes to. Above all I love the paddles and the magnetic system for attaching everything. It is SO easy to remove and swap out everything, yet it is still plenty secure while playing. I have NEVER lost/slipped a magnetic paddle, D-Pad, or stick while playing. This convenience is great, because if I am playing a game that doesn't require paddles, I take them off and put them in the controller case (which is also great by the way). Often times I will play with all four paddles, then no paddles, then just two paddles in the sames sitting with different games. Especially when just using it as a media remote, it is nice to be able to remove the paddles. When it comes to competitive games (from COD and Halo to even the likes of Rocket League) the paddles are your friend. I simply don't even want to play these same games without them!

The elite controller is simply the best I've ever used. I have played all Xbox consoles, most Playstations, all Wii consoles, and many Nintendo. Admittedly, I haven't tried a Scuff controller or other 3rd party upgrade, but I did lots of research before I went with the Elite comparing them and I have no regrets.

As far as the console itself, I will just name off some of my favorite features since at this point in the cycle everyone should be well aware of the basics.

The hybrid 1 TB hard drive is great. I can't compare it to a non hybrid drive as I haven't used that model of Xbox One yet, but it is very snappy with loading times. Also, 1 TB is essential given how you get 4 free games a month (two Xbox One games and two backwards compatible Xbox 360 games). Even with the larger drive I still usually just ""purchase"" the free games and cancel the install unless I really like them. You can always install them later.

One of my favorite features is streaming my games to my laptop. It is so easy and convenient! It is great to not have to move the xbox to another room to play it while my wife is watching one of her shows, or we are watching something together. We will just use our Chromecast to watch the show and I'll just connect my laptop over wifi and off I go! Even without being wired to the internet I can still play competitive multiplayer games (with rare noticeable lag). This is a wonderful feature.

Another favorite of mine is the Kinect. While I won't review that here (as it is a separate purchase from this bundle at about $100), it is an awesome  accessory that my wife and I use daily. I did NOT get it to play games (though there are a couple decent ones like kinect sports if you get at a low enough price), but instead I got it for voice commands, workouts, and Skype. Not all of the voice commands work super well, but as soon as you learn the ones that do and in what situations they are ideal for, it is a pretty sweet deal. I love getting home from work and telling the Xbox to turn on haha. Also love using Skype with it. Previously we would huddle around a laptop on the table or hold up a smartphone to video chat, which was never very comfortable for extended chats with far away family. Now, we can lean back on the couch!

The main reason I went with Xbox is because of the style of controller (not a fan of joystick placement on playstation) and the exclusives (gotta have my halo). From the view times I have seen similar games played on both consoles, I have not noticed any compelling difference in gameplay or graphics to make that a major deciding factor for me.

5.0,False,"06 19, 2011",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B003O6E800,Elias,"In the field of motion pictures, a generally accepted norm for ""greatest film ever made"" seems to be Orson Welles' classic
""Citizen Kane."" Because games are a relatively young medium compared to cinema, it was only until about 14 years ago that
a contender for ""greatest game ever made"" stepped forth. To this day, many consider it to be the birthing place of 3D conventions
that are still used quite frequently. That game is ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"", and on the 25'th anniversary of the
Zelda franchise, Nintendo has given it a facelift on it's newest handheld, the 3DS. Diehard fans of the original (raises hand)
and newcomers alike are about to astounded by the results.

For the virgins in the audience, ""Ocarina of Time"" follows Link, a young boy who lives in the Kokiri Forest, a place where children frolic about with fairy companions. But a peaceful game this is not, for the patriarch of the forest, The Great Deku Tree, summons the boy before him and reveals that he has a much bigger life ahead of him than previously expected. Before he passes on, the tree sends Link on a quest that will span vast distances, and transcend the very fabric of time itself. This quest will determine the future of Hyrule, for if the young warrior fails, the land which is home to thousands will be plunged into an eternity of nightmares by Ganondorf, known by many as the King of Evil.

With this plot, the stage is set for a journey of epic proportions. Back in the Nintendo 64 era, a game of this scope was unheard of, and revolutionized what we expected from interactive entertainment forever. But does it hold up by today's harsh standards? With what Nintendo has done, it not only holds up, but still exceeds a good 90% of what we see on the market in 2011. For a game made over a decade ago, that's no easy feat.

Of course, to do this, the developers had to perform cosmetic surgery on the whole experience. The first, most noticeable change is the fact that the graphics have been rebuilt entirely. Gone are the blocky sprites we saw so many years ago; every character, even the vast multitude of NPCs, are positively teeming with life, moving with fluid gestures we never thought capable from the game. That attention has also been given to the many locales the player will be visiting, with every town, dungeon and field popping off of the screen. These are the most impressive graphics out there on the 3DS right now, and without a doubt the most novel use of it's 3D capabilities. When plugged into a wall, playing with the 3D turned on is highly recommended, for it will provide an experience that simply must be seen to be appreciated.

But a simple graphical overhaul just wouldn't be enough for a game with admittedly antiquated mechanics, which is why ""OoT 3D"" makes brilliant use of the system's dual screens. The new gameplay eliminates having to shift through four different menus on one pause screen, allocating all item and equipment management to the bottom touch screen. The abilities to equip four items at once, to shuffle through equipment at a breakneck pace, and no longer having to equip the Ocarina are all welcome changes to the game. Also welcome is the gyroscope in the 3DS, meaning that you can now aim items such as the hookshot and bow with your own hands. This kind of interactivity beats even the Wii Remote aiming present in ""Twilight Princess"", and after engaging in it, you'll find it hard going back to the old method.

Some things shouldn't be touched when modifying the classics, though; just look at what Spielberg did to ""E.T."" One of the most beloved things about ""OoT"" is Koji Kondo's chill-inducing soundtrack, and diehards will pleased to know that it remains entirely intact in this remake. While it would've been nice to see some kind of orchestral rearrangement of the score, the nostalgia nerd in all of us will feel right at home with these tunes.

Extras, like the Master Quest and boss gauntlet, are really just icing on the cake. This is a killer version of a killer game, and perhaps now the strongest reason to own a 3DS. This writer cannot emphasize enough on how absolutely phenomenal this game is, and in the end, it's up to you to take the first step on your journey to save Hyrule, whether it's your first or five-hundreth.

Do you have what it takes?

The quality of the input buttons and joystick is nearly as good as the xbox controller. The layout is the same as the xbox controller, only the grip is shorter, but that is reasonable for portability purpose. It is very light weight, comparable to a small TV remote. Since the back is not shown in the picture, I can tell you that there are 4 trigger buttons. There are two for each side. For each side, a shoulder buttons for your index finger and a lower trigger button for your middle finger. I have no problem pressing them, and again, they feel like the xbox controller too. However, I do not think that the trigger buttons are analog sensitive. So far I verified that all the buttons work fine on the PSONE, PSP, and SNES emulator with all the buttons mapped out and joystick working properly. For the Android games, Asphalt 8 and Respawnable works. Modern Combat 4 does NOT work. I am running on a HTC ONE M7 4.40, but most Android phone should work fine. The phone mount unfortunately presses on my volume button, but that is fine, because I can control the volume directly from the controller! Those media buttons on the bottom is a HUGE selling point because it turns your phone into a media center if your phone already supports MHL cable, and my 2 year old phone supports it. The controller also has limited navigation through the OS. My only complaint is the d-pad. In short, the d-pad is ultra stiff, but most of my games play better with the joystick than with any d-pad. Another complaint is the bright red LED in the front. I'm fine with LED on a controller, but not bright LED. It would also be better with AA battery. I don't need a built-in rechargeable battery, I have rechargeable AA batteries already. Despite the complaints, I would still pick this controller over the other competition. And for iOS, don't even bother. I tried it on the iPad, and I simply can't find anything that just works with this controller.

How long does it take to get a match on line? A mere seconds, with dedicated servers , you'll be hard-pressed to not find a match within seconds not minutes. Having said that this is by far the best zombie game I've ever played , yeah I said it zombies , I don't care zombie purists will say they're not zombies, well OK 'Infected' , I'll give you that. Aside from that the only downside to L4D is there's only 4 campaigns with 5 maps each , it gets a little repetitive seeing the same environment , but behold there's DLC just around the corner opening up 2 more campaigns for VS. and a new mode called survivor. Anybody worth their multi player weight in gold MUST get this game, it is by far a fantastic achievement in co-op goodness. The game really forces you to work as a team , I always get giddy when I see a nube join and watch them run ahead like Masterchief thinking ""I can take these zombies"" Only to see them get nailed by a smoker or hunter a mere 20 feet from the safe house. That NUBE just learned one of the most valuable lessons in L4D  ""Stay Together"".

L4D really benefits teams who use real world swat tactics ' move and shoot, where you enter rooms one after another covering flanks. Its quite an intoxicating experience and one that NO gamer should miss. Teams that run around and jump like mad-max on crank , won't last long , L4D punishes solo artists but rewards team players.

The best on line game to grace my 360 since I first put it COD4 so long ago. Not a great comparison since both games are different , but I used the comparison because I think L4D is equally revolutionary as COD4 was and even more so becaue of  the AI director , which by developers interviews is only in its infancy stages of development. The AI director really works well , by throwing a different experience at you every time you run through the same map. More than a random enemy generator it throws enemies at you procedurally not random, and its a formula that is unmatched in just about any game this gen.

I think the best Villian was Dr. Doom. They should've had more story to him(Oh, Well). Overall it was a cool game. All of the FF Heros had cool combo attacks and super Moves. I enjoyed Playing The Thing & Mr. Fantastic. The Human Torch was kind of hard to fight with, because he was always flying. & The Invisible Woman was not so bad.

But I am a fan of Samurai/Ninja games (Tenchu, Way of the Samurai, Kengo, Bushido Blade). The only thing Shinobi has in common with prior games of the genre is that you fight with a sword. That's it. Shinobi is the fastest Samurai/Ninja game I've ever seen. This game is not about deep thinking or stealth. It is about speed and finesse.
What I liked about the game:
- Good graphics, high frame rates, and beautify cutscenes- though the cutscenes don't really move the plot along in any interesting way.
- The hero is very cool.
- Hero can pull off a wide variety of moves using very simple controls. To a spectator it all looks very cool.
- It's really your skill in finessing these moves that determines if you survive in this game. You have to master the rapid sequential kills (called TATE) in order to defeat the later bosses. This is not a Quake game, hacking at a boss repeatedly won't kill it. The controls are designed to assist you in reaching this state of ""TATE-ness"" but you have to allow it to happen- ie use the R1 button frequently.
- Also watch the demo screens when the game boots up, they are useful in figuring out what kinds of moves your character is capable of.
What frustrated me about the game:
- I was warned by prior reviews that this was a difficult game- it really is very difficult. It took me about a dozen tries to get through level 3. That's before I found out that I can cut through some of the walls in the Mall to reveal health bonuses. Fortunately if you get killed at a boss level you resume in the boss fight level, not at the beginning of the level.
- Camera has a mind of its own sometimes- especially in the most awkward times- like when you are trying to deal your death blow to a boss.
- Graphics is repetitive. For each level you enter, the textures are reused an aweful lot.
- There are no save points until an entire level (including boss) has been killed! This is the most frustrating thing about the game, but if you think about it for a moment, you'll quickly realize that being able to save the game at an arbitraty point would in fact kill the pace of the game.",Fast & Furious,1040860800,,,

That being said this game will not appeal to everyone who is not into puzzles.. The game itself is amazing,from the storyline to gameplay Superb. I will give a quick breakdown on how I feel in all departments..

Graphics: Sharp animation with nice crisp graphics

Storyline: Once you start you don't want to stop. All characters in this game feel involved and interesting. Unlike other games where you feel nothing for the characters because of lack of interest. The fact you have many multiple choices and have multiple endings makes replay value extremely high.

Sound: From the music to the Dubbing are done amazing. Many characters and not once sounds cheap or bad

Gameplay: Is where this game shines. There are endless ways to dies. Many traps,special attacks,bosses,sheep etc etc to stop you from getting to the top(Addicting) I was not able to put my controller down 3 hours straight until I had to go to work. Also the bar has a mini game arcade to brush up your skills which is 8-bit fun(more like 12 bit maybe lol) You can interact with everyone at the bar,each character also has a good amount of dialogue..Go to the bar grab a drink to be faster in the nightmare levels..There is so much I can type but I will leave that to the pro reviewers. Just want to fill in a bit..

Overall: I have not seen a game like this in ages..Fun,simple mechanic and appealing in multiple ways.

Flash forward to today, and I finally got the money to buy a copy. In my opinion there are only two underwater action games I've ever played worth buying. They are Sub Rebellion for the Playstation 2, and this awesome gem.

The graphics are absolutely amazing even today, and the underwater effects are spectacular. The controls are slightly complex, but tight and intuitive. Don't let all the control buttons scare you. Play for twenty minutes or so, give the first few levels a few tries, and you'll be hooked.

The premise of the game is what I imagined the Uncharted series would be before I played it. You are a treasure hunter who explores wrecks looking for treasure, fighting off hostile sea creatures and deadly scuba divers like something out of a James Bond film. You have a variety of equipment and weapons you can purchase and use, and they have different effects. For instance you can shoot sharks, or you can hit them with nets that deploy floats. There's floating gold bars and other treasures that are unrealistic and arcade-style, and it's kind of funny to see an ocean with pretty much nothing but monsters out to kill you, but this game is absolutely superb in every way. There's undersea currents that push you around underwater. Even your beginner sub is fast and maneuverable. You can play through levels rather quickly, and each is unique with different objectives, and is really fun to play.

If you enjoyed Sub Rebellion you need to play this game. If you enjoyed this game you need to play Sub Rebellion.

More and more, we are seeing PS4 games where the concept graphics differ virtually none from the actual game.  Furthermore, one cannot discern between real-time and pre-rendered scenes; the graphical fidelity is always top-notch and consistent.

At the outset, I would say, don't read a lot of reviews, watch videos, read walkthroughs, etc; as this game has numerous surprises, and it's way more fun when you get to experience the surprise for yourself.  Everything just *works*.  You're never left wondering how to do something or where to go, and it's so open-world, you can do anything in any order you wish.  Kudos to Sucker Punch and the game testers who made the gameplay FLAWLESS.  It wasn't so many years ago that even in an AAA title, it was difficult to make a character walk down stairs properly.  In this game, you can do EVERYTHING.  And all the side missions are interesting and have purpose, which is the way it should be.  They will gain you new knowledge, new abilities, and keep the story going, plus they are pure joy to do...  How can parkour and conduit powers ever get old?

And the engine!  We've kept hearing the word ""photorealism"", but this game really gets there.  In the cutscenes (which are realtime, not pre-rendered) the facial (and body) animation is truly the most realistic that I have seen since LA Noir; a great game that was a bit ahead of its time and didn't get enough light (pardon the pun) shun on it.

This game is EPIC.  It just keeps throwing new powers, new missions, new abilities, new plot elements, etc, at you, and never lets up.  Going for 100% is FUN, every second of it; but even then, you will want to re-play the game to play using the other Karma system.  This Karma system is great; it determines things that happen in the world, and your abilities, and even what the general public thinks of you.  It even becomes a challenge in itself; as if you get a ""Karma Streak"" you gain the ability to do an Orbital Drop, flying high in the air and then smashing down upon foes, leaving a large blast radius.  During a second play through as ""evil""/""Infamous"" Karma, the new powers, new missions, etc, all make for a very different play through, controls, scenes, dialogue, and all.

On that note, without any spoilers, I recommend going the ""good""/""Hero"" Karma route during the first play through.  Then you will be inspired to try to the evil Karma play through, which is quite a bit harder (it goes against instinct to not rescue people, people dislike you, etc; it is like New Game Plus, in my opinion).  This is great, though, as there are special powers associated with each, and different story lines, so the game can be what you make it, equalling at least two games in one!  The second play through is really great, because everything is different, you get to see what you missed the first time around.  This harkens back to the days of old NES games when you had a ""second quest"" after finishing the first!  And at least two REAL ENDINGS, they don't mess around.  And if/when there's DLC in the future, I will definitely be picking that up.  Kudos, too, for NOT having the typical ""micro transactions"" and other gimmicks that some publishers have been sneaking into their games.  It's a massive, complete game, and the extra wait shows they really gave it a lot of polishing.  This game is like a magician that never runs out of magic tricks.  It is really quite an accomplishment.

The game's AI is worth a mention, too...  Whatever rocket scientist came up with the enemy AI is a genius.  None of the old glitches fighting enemy AI are present in this game; enemies are incredibly intelligent and strategic.  They have to be!  Just think, when you have such a powerful protagonist, how do you make things challenging?  It's something they solved with great effort; it's perfection.  I'm also stunned at the pure amount of stuff going on at any time-citizens, traffic, street lights, not to mention all of the architecture, side quests, power ups, and a million other things.  It's a living, breathing, world, all in this game.  I predict quite a few studios will copy concepts invented for this game; it is innovation in its purest form.

Nearly everything in the game's wonderfully crafted world (with creative liberties) of Seattle is destructible, climbable, malleable, intractable...  The sky is the limit.  Doing a ""dash"" (where you turn into particles and swirl through the air"" is great for regaining health, but also lets you travel far-you can dash into air vents, and fly out of the tops of buildings!  Delsin sometimes exclaims, ""Wooooohooo!!!"", and that's pretty much the entire feeling of this game summed up into one word.  It's pure fun, gorgeous to look at (I've never used the screenshot/share function so much in any game).  There are more powers, but don't read up on them, experience the surprise for yourself!  It really keeps you guessing, which few games are able to do.

If you're a fan of 90s culture, you'll love the homage to that era and its music, as well.

Sucker Punch was one of the many dev studios flown out to Sony's Japanese studio to give input on what they wanted in an ideal console and controller, and it shows.  The controls are flat out perfect.  Really innovative and natural-feeling use of the touchpad on the PS4; I can't see gaming without it now.  The quick swipes, holds, two-finger holds, etc, all make perfect sense and never fail.  A lot of care was put into the crafting of this game, which has been in development since the inception of the PS4.  Did I mention, it was totally worth the wait?

This game was well worth the wait, and even better than the hype.  Sony, with the PS4, has pretty much shut down the Xbone with this latest epic game.  Don't believe reviews you see on MS marketing websites.  This game is easily a 10/10!

It's a great time to be a gamer, and PS4 is making that possible.  Kudos to Sony and Sucker Punch for creating such an epic and downright fun game.  Will be playing this one a looonnngg time.  I hope at some point, Sony will remaster, or at least port, the previous entries in the series, to be playable on PS4, as I'd be interested in those now, too (I somehow missed them before; this one is NOT to be missed)!  But firstly, I can't wait for DLC, sequels, etc!

Sony has promised 20+ exclusives for the PS4 this year alone, and are delivering in spades.  I can't wait to see the coming titles.  Being able to get games now straight through PSN (and Amazon codes for PSN), straight to the PS4, is a huge plus; no waiting in traffic to have a game store asking you for personal info that will go straight to marketing callers, etc.

Go with the limited edition of this game, since it's the same price but has added content.  Nothing major, but a few extras for the same price.  Either way, it is, as I mentioned, truly one of the greatest games ever made.

Lastly, I highly recommend the Sony&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gold-Wireless-Stereo-Headset/dp/B00HVBPRUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gold Wireless Stereo Headset</a>&nbsp;to go with the game.  This headset is excellent.  Once you use it, you'll never go back to TV speakers; you can hear so much more.  I've been using it for Killzone: Shadow Fall, Battlefield 4, and now InFAMOUS: Second Son.  The 7.1 surround sound (multiple speakers in each ear, and a mic for voice chat, plus noise canceling) actually really helps with gaming; as you can find items/players/etc by directional sound.  There is a headphone app, too, which allows you to load presets for mode 2 (there are 2 modes-normal mode and preset mode); Second Son already has its own preset available in the app, tuned specifically for the game.  Works great!!!  PS, if playing a multiplayer game like Killzone, hit the mute button on the side, and unmute when you need to talk (so others don't hear your background noise, etc; it's common courtesy).

These cute little creations live a life to run, jump, and explore.  The journey you guide them on may take them to many different places.  Some may be a lot of fun and others may be a little frustrating.  Little Big Planet is the game that may change the way you think about gaming.  It's much than just playing.  It's also about creating and sharing your creations with the world.  Let me go over each part of the game.

First and foremost a game would not be a game if it's not for playing.  In Little Big Planet your character is a little sack boy or sack girl.  Of course you can dress and design your character whichever way you like.  The sack boys and girls are also able to show different emotions that range from happy to angry and sad.  There are many combinations to make your character that much more expressive.  The characters movements are rather simple.  You can run, jump, and grab.  You really don't have to worry about seven or eight different controls.  As you progress thru the game you may be wanting more controls.  The game is narrated beautifully by Stephen Fry.  He will give you tutorials thru many of the beginning levels.  This is a side scroller game.  Which is something the gaming consoles don't see of much nowadays.  Although it's a little different than standard side scrollers in which the game has three layers that can make some challenges that much more tricky.  Many of the level designs are beautiful and well thought out.  Each level is part of a theme that comes from all different parts of the world.  From Europe to Africa, North America and Asia the whole world is covered.  The music that accompanies each level is also from the different parts of the world.  My only qualm is that the game does get difficult about halfway thru.  The levels can become quite frustrating if you get stuck on a certain spot.  I am more than familiar with the frustrated feeling.  Now you can play with up to three other players in co-op mode which is a lot of fun.  This allows you to take on some two player challenges to unlock extras on each level.  Although this is an important part of the game it is only one piece.

The next part of the game I want to talk about is the create part.  In Little Big Planet you can create just about anything you have floating around in your head.  If you are the creative type or just want to recreate your favorite game or movie this is your chance.  As you progress further in the regular game you will be able to unlock more items to decorate your creation.  It's a lot of fun just to try out some of the tools that are accessible in this game.  The psyhics are incredibly realistic.  If you want to build something you have to remember that items can have a mind of their own when you put them into your world.  What makes creating a level that much more exciting is the ability you have to share them with the world.  Players can rate your creation or creations.  The better your creation scores the easier it will be for other players to access that level.  You as a player well be able to access others creations from all over the world.  This could lead to hundreds if not thousands of excellent levels over the months.  This will lead to unlimited replayibility in the game.

The last part of the game I would like to cover is the community aspect.  You as a player will be able to play with up to three others.  They can be off your friends list or just individuals you have never met.  All in all this will add quite a bit more fun to the game.  A game like Little Big Planet is meant to be played with others.  With the latest patch the online portion of the game is working much better now.  It's a great time to play many of these well crafted levels that the public at large created.

Overall Little Big Planet is quite a step in terms of gaming.  Simple in many aspects and utterly amazing in the creation aspect.  This is a game that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  Some aspects of this game are not perfect but that shouldn't stop anyone from playing.  Gamers and non gamers can have fun with the sack boys and girls.  See you in the Little Big Planet...",After all it is a Little Big Planet,1225152000,15,,

It's one of those games that you will have to keep trying again and again until you beat a level and I love games like that. Although, depending on what difficulty setting you have it on, you may want to make sure you don't upgrade until you need to to make sure the game stays challenging. You can upgrade things such as your health, unibeam, repulsor, etc. When I played this game on a normal setting, I had completely forgotten about upgrades until level 5 and when I did upgrade, the game got easier. I recently played it on super hero difficulty and even though I upgrade when I get enough points, it's still a challenge. Also, in the levels, there are certain amount of things such as tanks, helicopters, etc., so you can get points for upgrades depending on how many of them you destroy. I also like that it gives you things to do after you've completed the game. In One Man Army, ranging from easy to hard, you basically see how many stuff you can blow up until you die.

Stupidly fun, characters are great, gameplay is SIMPLE almost in a ridiculous  scale, although it does not affect the gaming experience.

PROS:
- Tons of characters to chose from + Unlockable characters as you play!
- Tons of stages, many of them are really fun taking you back from Donkey Kong to Xenoblade Chronicles!
- Nintendo DELIVERS - I have not found glitches, FREE MULTIPLAYER , 8 PLAYER option to play with your folks
- Music, Nostalgia when you play into an old video game stage, it really enhances the experience and makes you want to play it more.
- Play modes, as mentioned before you can play with a friend online and team up to fight against other players, training mode, conquest, among other relevant features.
- Joining to online multiplayer is ridiculously fast!
- I'm probably missing more stuff!

CONS:

- I experience some lag a couple of times (not concerning though) but it is more related to ISP probably.
- Although the game has many modes, the Main Menu could be more organized, it took me a while to find Training among other options.
- I can't find how to setup the Gamepad and use arrow buttons rather than the Gamepad sticks. You might have some issues trying to get use to the analog sticks.

But it was purchased for a child, and the target audience is almost certainly children, and here it seems to be a very good fit.  My daughter can play a number of PS3 Move games with varying levels of success, and enjoys them.  But it has been a struggle to find something on the PS3 that isn't a Move game she can play.  Not only can she play this game, but we can play it together, and she is starting to get into it and is beginning to understand some of the concepts aside from just running around on the level while watching the reaction as she pushes buttons aimlessly.  I haven't noticed that the player can die.  The character seems to re-spawn having lost some gold after the health meter is exhausted.  This game employs great big blue arrows to tell the player where to go next, what ""thing"" to grab next, etc.  This is an aid for a child that helps them solve puzzles as they go through the level.  She has figured out the gold and that when she smashes things, beats enemies, and completes challenges she can get more of it.  Which excites her because she has figured out where the costumes are and that the more gold she collects, the more of them she can unlock and the more levels she can unlock.  When she completes a level by herself, the pride she takes in that accomplishment is rather amusing.  The fact that it keeps her entertained and thinking for an hour is a bonus.

For the more experienced gamer or older child, collecting all items on the level can sometimes be a challenge.  The blue arrows only get one through the level.  There are plenty of items to find and challenges to complete that take a bit more skill.  Playing together or with others is nice.  I wish the PS3 had more games like this (perhaps I just haven't found them).  The costume upgrades and unlock-able costumes will seem pretty shallow to an experienced gamer.  I do wish they altered play more.  Team play can be cooperative, or competitive.  With players of such a great skill gap, cooperative play seems best.  I am looking forward to trying this game with some older people to see the results that competitive play can yield.  From some of the obstacles and traps I've noticed in game, that could be a good deal of fun.

This game is set up in such a way that one will want/need to replay levels.  Whether it is to collect more gold, upgrade costumes, get a higher level score, find all the collectibles, or just have fun, replay is part of the game.  I suspect the depth and breadth will be lacking here as well.  There is no indication that there are areas of levels locked out until one has a certain costume or has upgraded to a certain level.  That would be a nice addition for a sequel. The trophies in this game look like they would be pretty accessible to any experienced gamer if that is something you are interested in.

You see the war through each of these soldiers eyes, so in otherwords, its a first person shooter. Anyway, you get a lot of authentic WW2 weapons which include Panzershreks, MP40s, M1 Garands, Thompsons, etc and you get to shoot and blow up things like Halftracks and Tiger Tanks. Ontop of that, you get smoke & frag grenades to toss around at will. There is a multiplayer which is pretty fun - you pick a team (ie: British, Nazis, Americans..you get it) and go toe to toe with a friend or friends in random places that has WW2 history.

The objectives in each level sually require you to either clear out houses room by room, snipe out mortar teams, fend off a massive German counterattack, or place a bomb on something. Its pretty fun and intense because you'll be fighting off wave after wave of Nazis and artillery while trying to achieve your goal, but it becomes sorta repetitive during the later levels..

I want to stress the word ""intense"" on this game. You will always be on your toes, always firing at hordes of enemies. This game isn't easy, even on the easy difficulty, and is ridiculously hard on the Veteran difficulty. The hardest in my opinion is the American campaign during the battle of Point Du Heuc... if you think Medal of Honor: Frontline's Arnhem Knights level is difficult, wait till you see this. Also, this game is pretty long so don't try rushing it hah.

Moving on, you'll be fighting in very detailed and wartorn areas such as Egypt, France, Russia, and even Germany. I was impressed with the beautiful looking enviroments when up close, and the character models look amazing. However, the levels feel kind of linear. You are pretty limited as to where you can go, but I guess we can look past that.

The sound effects were great - I really loved the explosions. The voice acting was great, and actually helpful because your allies would be like ""Kraut on the 2nd floor, black building"" and basically point out enemies to you.

What lowered this game from being a 9? Well for starters its in a genre that has been basically played to death. Ontop of that the guns weren't very accurate nor did some of them seem very powerful. I felt ripped off when I shot a guy with the BAR and he just sort of kelled over, got up and shot me again. Meh. Also, like I mentioned, the objectives started to get repetitive.

The ending was kind of a rip off at first - a simple news reel explaining how the Allies won - but once the credits roll, the real ending begins. It shows a bunch of troops battling it out in some destroyed city againt tanks, nazis, and airplanes. It was like watching a movie.

To sum it all up, if you got an X-Box 360 then you need to play this game. It isn't the best in my opinion, but it sure is a lot of fun. Go buy it.",COD2 is packed with awesome WW2 action..,1155772800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I don't have an Xbox, but my buddy does so I was able to play the game quite a bit, and I really got into it. I have been waiting ever since to finally be able to play this game myself on the computer. And when I heard they would be releasing it with even more content, I got even more excited. I was not expecting that, but am very glad that they did nonetheless.

Some people may complain it might still be a little on the shorter end (in comparision to other games on the market) but I for one do not care. The game is so intriguing and simply FUN to play, that I can look past this. And also, being able to go through the entire game several times (being good, being bad, and then good again,etc.) and doing different things each time like at the end is awesome and lengthens the game's life anyways.

It is just like the Xbox version in that you can keep playing after the final boss which is nice. That way if you missed any side quests you can still complete them if you would like.

The graphics look real sharp too. You can see battle scars and notice as your character ages which is really cool.

For those who are into using a lot of the Will Powers, there are plenty to choose from but unfortunately you can only have two in your quick-access menu. For the rest you actually have to bring up the Will Powers menu to select them. I'd prefer to just be able to asign hot keys for all them, but its forgivable.

For those who have played the original several times through, there isn't too much different until u get to head to the new area they added, which I found to be really enjoyable.

There is one quirk that I have noticed so far, and it is relatively minor. That is the controls. The default setup just doesnt feel right. Like it has the middle mouse button being the block button, which just doesnt work for me. And the lock-on button seems a little out of place too. But luckily like almost all games, the controls are customizable so its no big deal. After some customization I was back to tearing up bandits :)

In short, it's definitely worth a look, and in my opinion- worth buying. You shouldnt be disappointed with this game.",finally for the PC,1127260800,129,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

It is too noisy, very hot and I had to have it repaired for the ""3 rings of death"" problem everyone else has. I mean I played Nascar '08 with the sound turned up and could still here the XBox 360 DVD drive churning!

I recently bought the PS3 40GB model because I want to start watching Blu-ray on my HD TV and play some of the PS3 only titles. What a pleasant surprise. The PS3 is so quiet, I can consider keeping it running when not doing anything. Blu-ray videos are a real treat and the PS3 doesn't feel like someone turned on a space heater when it is powered up.

While I was disappointed that I can't play my PS2 titles on it, the PS2 is still here, so that's not a big deal.

Finally, having Playstation Network free of charge is great. It isn't as good as XBox Live in some ways, but Sony keeps improving it. For the price, it is a great value add.

5.0,False,"02 20, 2005",A1GWLHT83J98FN,B0001B15RA,SoCalReviews,"I have been playing video games since the Atari 2600 and Intellivision days.  I also owned the first Nintendo, a Sega Genesis, and a Dreamcast (which is still one of my favorite console video game machines I ever purchased. Unfortunately you cannot purchase a new Dreamcast machine or new games in the stores). I have owned an XBox for about two months now.  This is a very complete video game machine with all the bells and whistles like a hard drive, ethernet, Dolby Digital 5.1 Sound, support for High Definition TV, etc.

Pros: XBox has the best graphics, sound, and the most features of all the consoles. It supports up to four controllers unlike the PS2 which has only two built in ports. If you really want to get into online console gaming and you have a high speed internet connection then XBox is the one to get. As of the last year or two most of the games for the other consoles are now being released on the XBox.

Cons: The XBox is much larger and heavier than the others which makes it more difficult to transport.  In addition to you having a high speed broadband internet connection an annual ""XBox Live"" subscription (currently costs about $50) must be purchased before  you can use the system's online gaming features. PS2 has many more games ( including the older PS1 games if you own any of those) and although the graphics on the PS2 are not quite as good as XBox it is still a fun and popular console. Your PS2 games will be supported by the future PS3 machine which protects your PS2 and PS1 game investment while the XBox2 may not support the older XBox games.

I like the XBox console and most of the games are great.  If you are really into video games then for $150 I would recommend an XBox purchase.  If you have a PS2 or Gamecube then XBox is still a good addition. If you don't own another console then XBox might be the best way to go since it is the most advanced console and you can always buy a PS2 or Gamecube later if you want. I plan on purchasing a PS2 in the near future just to have it for a few of those older PS1 and PS2 games that were not released for XBox.

If you are into PC based gaming don't expect the XBox to be better than your $1500 Windows XP computer with a good graphics card. The PC CPU power, graphics, and internet gaming is going to be superior to any of the current gaming consoles. XBox is simply the the best console you can hook up to your TV. Consoles are much better for relaxing on the couch or with multiple game players. If you want to best your PC machine then wait for XBox2 or PS3.

The best XBox sports games are ESPN NFL2K5 , ESPN NHL2K5 and Madden NFL 2005. Halo 1 and 2 are fantastic theme based shooter games as I am sure you have already heard. I personally like some of the older retro-games like Sonic for XBox and Atari Anthology, as well as the newer retros available for XBox like the Crash Bandicoot, the Silent Hill horror series, and the Metal Gear Solid and Tom Clancy theme spy games.

The bottom line: If you don't mind spending the money now for this four year old technology then an XBox is highly recommended and it is the best choice of all the current consoles.  If you don't mind waiting then look forward to the state of the art PS3 and XBox2 to be released in late 2005 or early 2006.",The best console machine on the market at the moment.,1108857600,20,,

This game is no exception , from start to finish the game had me so enthralled in the story I just didn't want to stop playing..

If you are one of those people that think this game is just a game of quick time events ( QTE ) you would be completely wrong.. You have to initiate the QTE .. The fighting machanics of this game can be easily compaired to the batman games , they are fast and fluid.. You will need to rely heavily on your blocking/shield , without it you will die very quickly. Once you get the block , stagger , and attack combonations down its pretty much smooth sailing from there on out.. Im not saying it's completely easy from there but everything is alot more managable after you get everything down. YOU WILL STILL DIE THROUGH OUT THE GAME !! You will run into hords of ememies that at some points seem overwhelming , but after you die a few times you will see the things you are doing wrong and correct it.

The graphics are nothing but amazing in this game and simply something that could not be accomplished with the previous generation ( Xbox 360 , PS3 ) . Everything is just so detailed and beautiful to look at. I have found that after clearing an area of enemies I like to stop and just look around and appreciate the surroundings I am playing in..

In my opinion this game is nearly flawless and deserves nothing less than a 5 out of 5.. Don't listen to the paid professional reviews , if you want a real honest and truthful review , just read the user reviews.. There have been so many times I have seen profesional reviews really trounce on a game and give it poor reviews but doesnt reflect the actual user reviews that are much higher. One of the worst reviews I have ever seen was  by Adam Sessler from G4 tv reviewing Darksiders.. I can't remember exactly what score he gave it but he gave either a one or two star review.. That was a totally inacurate review of the game.

Look at the actual user reviews. What I'm trying to tell you is to look for yourself and play the games you want instead of listening to the '"" professional "" reviews.. As a matter of fact Sessler even gave this game a bad review and even admitted in his review he didn't complete the game..

On a final note , just pick up the game and play it if you are interested , it really is an excellent game and one that you will always remember..",Just what I expected from Crytek !!!,1389225600,2,"{'Edition:': ' Day One', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

I was not disappointed! The game is gorgeous, to start with.
It may not be the game to showcase the power of the PS4 but I've seen the game running on last gen and it really does have a graphical advantage on PS4.

There are some parts of the game play that feel a bit annoying (Edward seems to hang up on walls and such at the worst moments possible) but the minor frustrations were not enough to keep me away.

Oh the sea...the sea is gorgeous and I had the most fun just sailing around on my ship and listening to my crew sing shanties. The shanties really made this game special...if there is a sequel I hope they can bring in some new ones because I'm hooked. (Still waiting on a complete shanty mp3 release for this game!)

Do not worry about not understanding what's going on if you haven't played the rest of the series. There are references to those games (especially Liberation) but for the most part this is it's own tale and is a story that does not rely on previous games to understand.
I think Ubisoft could have made it's own pirate series with this game...and I kind of hope they do.

I won't spoil anything, but the ending is simpler than I thought and very emotional. I still have to go to Youtube after beating it just to experience it again. I think I'll go right now.

With the use of the tomahawk, blades and bow. You will be doing missions in fighting against the red coats and riding along Paul Revere. Assassin's Creed does a great job in adding a character to what is already history. The visuals of the games makes thing game so beautiful.

As the story goes on October 1, 1997 (this game came out in 1990) the End Day involves a cataclysmic war which causes the Earth to change on its axis and causes mutations through the world.  A scientist is awakened from his cryogenic sleep and is given the task to stop Draygon from using an ancient tower in the sky as the ultimate weapon of destruction.  Along the way, the hero will meet four ""wise men"" (Asina is actually a woman but whatever) who will help provide clues to seek out the four elemental swords that will help him conquer his enemies.  You gain experience by beating enemies and leveling up, gain or buy items which causes you to really think how to use them, learn eight magic spells (healing, telepathy, teleport, etc.).  There was only a few times when I needed to consult an online player's guide but it is mostly straight-forward.

5.0,True,"10 2, 2009",A7S389T88I0HC,B0029MAXR2,Patricia Laverty,"We always hear from developers that they've upped the scale, scope and all-round epic nature of their game for the sequel. So and so game has twice as many levels, another has bigger bosses, another includes some new moves. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is a game that has more variety than you could ever imagine, a storyline that spans the globe, enemies so diverse you expect something new around every corner, combat so brutal you'll be wincing until the closing credits and a style that is effortlessly cool. Ninja Gaiden 2 was more bad ass than its predecessor in every conceivable way, and this PS3 exclusive refresh is even better... for the most part.
If you haven't been following the Ninja Gaiden series over the past few years you probably aren't prepared for how difficult Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is, even if it's definitely easier than the 360 original. It's still on a completely different level to current genre favourite God of War. To put Ninja Gaiden 2 into perspective, I was able to beat God of War and its sequel fairly comfortably on the default difficulty - on the easiest difficulty Ninja Gaiden 2 almost made me gnaw my fingers off at certain points. Newcomers will definitely appreciate Sigma 2's more forgiving gameplay, but unless you're 100 per cent focused don't expect to make it very far.
Although lead character Ryu Hayabusa gains quite a selection of weaponry as you move through the game, it's his block and dodge moves that are key to survival. You might be able to button mash your way through one or two enemies, but soon enough you'll be using health elixirs like no tomorrow and seeing the Game Over screen enough to have it burnt onto your retinas. Learn to use your block and when to counter attack and you'll be on your way.
Playing Ninja Gaiden 2 is a very different experience to playing the majority of games. Whether it's for simply beating a wave of blood-thirsty bats or for finally slaying a boss you've been tearing your hair out over for more than an hour, the sense of reward and gratification is practically unrivalled. For every level you beat you feel like you're becoming a better gamer and that's a feeling that very few games can claim to give. This is action gaming at its very best, although with the toned down carnage during combat there's a nagging sense that Sigma 2's not quite the ultimate edition of the game it could have been.
That being said,Its still an amazing Game.
Joining your melee weapons are a number of projectiles, ranging from your default shuriken to a gatling gun-style spear gun for use underwater. Most of these have a limited supply of ammo, with more available from fallen warriors you find on your adventure and at shops scattered around each level. Handily, Ryu automatically targets enemies when using a projectile weapon, although weapons like the bow and gun can be manually aimed if you want to hit a certain location on an enemy. One of the keys to the game is working out which weapons work best against each enemy type, so thankfully the d-pad offers a quick weapon-change, eliminating the need to go into the pause menu.

Your third means of attack comes from magic, or Ninpo as it's called in the game. Fire-filled icons below your health bar show how many Ninpo strikes you have at your disposal. Holding down Triangle and Circle initiates a monster slaying Ninpo attack and you have a few seconds to aim using the left analogue stick. As with your weapons, these powers can be upgraded, allowing you to dish out more damage. To begin with you're limited to a fire attack, but soon enough this will be joined by wind and fire bird assaults. Unless you're a true expert these special magic abilities will be essential during boss battles, so it's wise to stock up on replenishing items.
 Brand new to Sigma 2 are three extra playable female characters. Rachel from Ninja Gaiden, Ayane from Dead or Alive and Momiji from DS game Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword each offer a different gameplay experience during their brand new levels. Rachel is still as slow as she was in the original Sigma title on PS3, so is just as likely to divide opinion amongst fans, but the other two should go down quite well as their combat styles are fast and flowing like Ryu's. They each have brand new weapons to play with, too.
Enemies in Ninja Gaiden 2 come thick and fast and in large groups. You'll face warriors, giant lizard monsters, dogs, frenzied bats, gargoyles, metallic scorpion-like spinning nasties, werewolves, flying piranhas and more - in fact, that lot are just from the game's opening third. Your health bar in Ninja Gaiden 2 uses a replenishment system, meaning you don't need to use elixirs to get your energy back. When you beat a wave of enemies your health is re-filled, but any sustained damage (shown by red in your bar) is permanent unless you use a health elixir or blue essence. Fallen enemies release essences of various colours, with yellows acting as the in-game currency used to purchase new items and upgrade weapons, Reds replenish your magic, and blues heal semi-permanent damage.
You don't always want to absorb these essences for health though. By holding down the Triangle button Ryu draws them in, allowing him to unleash an Ultimate Technique move. These devastating moves destroy any enemies standing in your way and look spectacular to boot. The standard combat in the 360 version was extremely brutal, with limbs flying and blood spilling all over the place, but this PS3 game has been quite significantly toned down - something that is likely to anger and disappoint fans hoping this would be the ultimate version of the game. Limb and head dismemberment doesn't leave bloody stumps but instead a glowing purple patch. On 360 all the carnage remained in place too, with body parts lying strewn across the floor and blood smeared over walls. This just doesn't happen to the same extent here and the combat loses some of its edge as a result. Still, the new obliteration moves, triggered by pressing Triangle near to a damaged enemy, are pretty brutal.. It's essential you perform these finishing moves as enemies will keep going at you until they're dead - one set of enemies even commit suicide by blowing themselves up while on top of you.

In stills Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 doesn't come close to showing its true beauty, although the reduction in gore has made the game less spectacular to see in motion. It doesn't have the same ""WOW"" factor of something like Killzone 2, but it's still a fine looking game when running at a pin-sharp 1080p resolution. The best is reserved for the bosses, which are immense. We're talking proper Shadow of the Colossus scale beasts here, each with numerous attack stages and techniques for taking them down. Just when you think you've seen it all you'll come face to face with another giant monstrosity that defies belief. As with the rest of the game, they're no push over either, with my PS3 controller coming dangerously close to being hurtled towards the TV screen on more than one occasion. Even better for PS3 owners is the fact that Sigma 2 includes a number of bosses not included in the original 360 game!

 Completely new to the PS3 game is online cooperative play during a number of special challenge stages. It's a shame that there's no story mode to play through with a friend, but the inclusion of any multiplayer at all can only been seen as a good thing. It does make for a rather more chaotic experience, so be prepared for a screen full of carnage. Sadly there's no split-screen co-op, but you can play with an AI partner offline. With medals to go for and stages set across four difficulties there's plenty here to keep you playing once you're done with the campaign. You've also got online leaderboards, although given the game's hardcore following you're going to have to be pretty good to get anywhere near the top.

Everything isn't perfect of course. The story is largely forgettable and simply serves to fill the gap between levels. Voice acting is pretty cheesy too, although the voices of the main baddies are typical '80s cartoon quality, which makes them sound pretty menacing and cool. Swimming is once again something I'd rather avoid if possible, with the underwater controls feeling a tad clumsy. Running on water is handled well, but if you get caught in a fight it's all too easy to miss an attack and fall in, resulting in some easy hits for your foes. Some complaints could also be levelled at the save points, which on occasion are a little too spread out and the frame rate drops from time to time during particularly action packed moments just as it did in the 360 game.",Excellent Upgrade.,1254441600,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

5.0,False,"09 9, 2009",A1VMERUCN0Z1S7,B001M22WMY,E. Coleman,"After reading the mixed reviews for this controller, mostly leaning towards negative.  I decided to go for it anyway.  I grew up playing fighting games with a D-Pad not a joystick or an analog stick.  Sega Genesis and Sega Saturn D-Pad's to be exact.  But the Official Xbox 360 Controller D-Pad is horrible in comparison to those.  So I needed something to replace it.  Basically just about any other 3rd party D-Pad for the 360 is going to be better.  Thats how bad the official 360 controllers D-Pad is.  So yes this controller has a nice D-Pad.  When I want to go forward or back.  It does it and nothing else.  Up or down.  It does that as I wanted.  up & forward or up & backward.  Also does it, no problem.  Special Movies...much easier.  I can't say its the greatest D-Pad in the world.  But it is more then good enough to make an old school Genesis/Saturn player like me happy. The button layout is also nice for old school fans.  Having the buttons laid out similiar to a Genesis/Saturn Controller or Arcade button layout.  It works great.  The buttons are slightly more springy which is good for fighting games.  All the buttons and controls worked perfect for me.  No delay, improper or unresponsive controls.  I didn't have to mash them to make them respond nor did I lightly tap them and they responded too quickly.  It felt just right in response.  Comparable to an Official 360 Controller.  This is also a great controller for any game that is on live arcade that you may be used to playing on a D-Pad.  Sonic The Hedgehog games for instance.  It works nicely.  The pad gives turbo which is a cheat basically but it works nicely for people who enjoy that sort of thing and isn't hard to use.  The pad has a switch on the lower back that lets you change the D-Pad to the Left 360 Analog Stick Control or Right 360 Analog Stick Control.  This is a limited feature but it makes a few newer 360 games playable that might otherwise not be, if you want to use this controller for such games.  But overall this controller is for fighting games and old school games.  The overall layout of the controller felt very nice in my hands.  The Street Fighter IV photo (Blanka in my case) looks very nice.  The controller had a light rubberized grip on the back.  Felt very comfortable in my hands.  People with large hands, small hands or anything in between, shouldn't have a problem with it.

But there is a few things one should know about this controller and understand first.  Most games that use a 6 button layout such of Street Fighter II HD, Garou Mark Of The Wolves, Samurai Showdown II, etc.  Will not automatically work with the controller.  You'll need to manually map out the buttons.  Usually by accessing the games settings screen.  It's very easy to do and once you do it.  Your playing the game like it should be played.  No bumpers needed.  Just a D-Pad and 6 buttons.  Nice and simple.  Street Fighter IV of course does worth perfectly with the controller from the start.  It was afterall made for that game specifically.  But most games which require six buttons will need to be manually set.  The other issue is the controller does not feel very durable.  After a few days of use, it still works fine for me.  But it feels rather hollow.  The build quality is certainly not that of an Official Xbox 360 Controller which feels strong in comparison.

The final two things I should mention are not the controller makers fault, but something you should rememeber, it's not wireless and it doesn't have rumble.  So keep that in mind.  I got over both of those issues very quickly when I felt the nostalgia of playing games like I used to when I was younger.  The old Genesis style controllers.  I got that feeling back right away.  The official 360 controller doesn't give off that feel for older games.

And so I say, do not hesitate if your looking for a great controller for retro games, It works great, it looks great.  It does exactly what I hoped it would do and more.",Better Than Expected...,1252454400,4,"{'Edition:': ' Blanka', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

5.0,True,"11 16, 2016",A3Q4NULWZU3RI,B00ZM5ON88,Jason Sum,"It's really hard to review a game like Dishonored 2

If you didn't care for the first game this isn't going to be your thing
I put 6 hrs into it so far (not trying to speed my way through it)

Story: This is where the game lost me a little (No matter how you played the original game it doesn't link up with this game)
The Original game has different endings
The story is very interesting if you were invested in the first title
So far most of it makes sense

Gameplay: This is where this game gets dicey
It's a FP Stealth game but, they will give you guns, arrows, and various bombs
But, If you are to extreme and kill to many (The Chaos is High)
I forgot this silly manic balancing act made me dislike parts of the Original Dishonored
The game isn't balanced
Also the chaos meter is never explained to the player (Maybe i blinked and missed it)
I played the first Chapter (Escaping the castle to the Ship) on low Chaos
Maybe killed two guards mostly by accident, didn't kill any innocent bystanders
Meet with the Outsider then took a row boat to a new region
(Which starts Chapter 2) as soon as i get off the boat I'm in High Chaos!
How does that makes any sense? I never was in high chaos in the first chapter
Also you can play the game as Corvo or his daughter Emily
This should add playability to the game
You can also pass on getting any Supernatural powers from The Outsider
Like a smock i didn't take the powers when they were offered to me
I hope there is a pay off or at least a point  why you can pass getting them
This to could add more play ability to the over all narrative

Controls: Are solid once you get the hang of how you play
It seems as though you move much quicker in this game
(I could be wrong haven't played the Original in a while)
It's not as easy and pick up and play as a Bioshock
It's more like Thief (Re-make) the learning curve isn't bad maybe 15-20min. and you'll be good to go

Graphics: Solid the strange Half life/Team fortress art style returns
Which isn't a bad thing...... With all the same cookie cutter FPS trying to go the ultra realistic route this is very unique and refreshing
It's a stunning looking FPS But, the art style might also turn off certain people

Sound/V.O Cast: the sound is once again close to perfect
the background score fits in this world (Much like the original)
everything has it's own sound
The only returning v/o cast member is
April Stewart  (Empress Jessamine Kaldwin-Corvo's Heart/Emily's Heart)
everyone else is all new which is a shame
Erica Luttrell  (Empress Emily Kaldwin) plays the grown up Emily it would've been nice to get Chlo Moretz  to return But, I understand she has blown-up since the original game was in production
None the less Erica does a bang-up job she has the right voice and her performance is very good
The way she reads her lines reminds me of the actress that did Elizabeth's voice in  BioShock Infinite
It's a close to perfect performance so far!
Robin Lord Taylor is the new voice of The Outsider (Which is very cool)
Stephen Russell  (Corvo Attano)
Rosario Dawson  (Captain Meagan Foster) Which makes sense since Rosario has a great voice for doing v/o work
Vincent D'Onofrio  (Duke Luca Abele)
Sam Rockwell  (Mortimer Ramsey)
Pedro Pascal  (Paolo) Really underrated actor it's very cool he got this gig
Jamie Hector  (Vice Overseer Liam Byrne)
Once again you have a laundry list of heavy Hollywood hitters doing v/o on a video game!

The only real negative is the manic balancing act
The game itself ""claims"" you can play it your way
But, that isn't true since any negative actions are held against you
Why even have a Low/High Chaos meter
If you can play it your way?
It's very much like the first couple of Dead Rising games where the clock is stacked against you
This in no way effects the overall game But, it hinder it from being a perfect story drive epic adventure
The game is epic and  ambitious But, it's also very manic it's not sure what it wants to be
In a way it falls in it's own trap
Is it the same cookie cutter FPS??? or a rare first person stealth game  9/10

While apocalypse  games are typically rendered in shades of brown and grey , insomniac ( the developers ) have created a vibrant color filled playground. Everything is bright and beautiful , its like an explosion of beautiful colors that never stop. It really reminds me of an over the top amusement park that spans miles and miles ( this is a huge open game world ) ..

Insomniac has created a frenetic traversal system that provides you with the ability to grind along power lines , bounce off cars , run along skyscrapers and skim across water , you could literally travel the whole city and never set one foot on the ground. The system is also very forgiving , if you miss your jump there is always something else close by to grab ahold of and continue to grind away..

The sense of freedom in this game even extends to your character. At any time during the game you can change your characters looks , from big or small , shaggy or smooth , white , black or brown.. It can all be changed letting you reimagine yourself at any time. The many wacky and over the top customization is simply mind-boggling.

Your ultimate goal is to take down the evil corporation that unleashed the orange colored swill on the city's population and escape the city. Along the way there are ninja cheerleaders , killer balloons , and spoiled brats just to name a few and you also get an awesome appearance of buzz Osborne.. lol , like I said before , this game is over the top ..

The weapons in this game are various and like everything else over the top and sometimes WAY over the top. You can literally run around with a penis shaped weapon spitting green energy fire as you run around destroying the enemies around you. This kept me laughing to myself for quite a while when I had the weapon equipped. This is just one example of the crazy array of weapons you have at your disposal.

If you want a break from the long campaign , take your play online with some friends with modes specifically designed with co op in mind. This is a game you can enjoy completely alone or with some of your favorite friends , its really has something for everyone..

To wrap this up , if you want an insanely fun games with over the top game play and an explosion of beauty on your screen then this is the game for you. This open world RPG/shooter simply has it all and will not disappoint..

If you're going on a pure combat mission, throw in some extra guns and dump some speed capability, and even stuff like how many engineers or security officers you have on board.  Though you only command one ship at a time, there are 24 different ships to choose from, so you can upgrade to better ships or faster ships or whatever between missions.  How well you do on missions controls how much money you make, which determines how many upgrades you can get.  Keep in mind though -- this isn't a micromanagement game but an action game. And the graphics are awesome.
Also, as an added bonus, in this game you can import captains from the Starship Creator 2 game.",Can't Wait,979084800,40,,

As for the keyboard, typing on it is a dream.  If you don't mind the clickety clack of keys (I kind of enjoy it actually), then it's a fantastic keyboard.  The click are very responsive and even though it's a slightly shrunken keyboard, it's got next to no learning curve to get yourself used to it.

I bought this one primarily for gaming as I have limited space on my keyboard tray.  With my old Logitech keyboard, I had only 6"" or so of space for my mouse which meant I spent a lot of time picking it up and moving it.  The deletion of the 10key give you an extra 3-4""  for your mouse.

5.0,False,"11 26, 2002",AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00006M3R6,Irish,"The famed 'Metroid' series really hit its stride with the release of ""Super Metroid"" for the Super NES platform.  It did away with the monotony of ""Metroid II"" and enhanced the gameplay and environment of the original ""Metroid"".  The puzzles and challenges presented by this version captivated all kinds of gamers.  It re-hashed the original story and gave it some extra kick.  New weapons and abilities were introduced, as were more complex storylines.  Having never played any of the 'Metroid' games before this one, it was quite a spectacular introduction.

Now, fast foward a few years.  Knowing that the new GameBoy Advance System is making quite a profit out of porting old Super NES games for handheld, I was interested to see if Nintendo was going to put ""Super Metroid"" on the GBA.  Well, they did, sort of.  The game that ended up being developed for GBA was called ""Metroid Fusion"" and it resembles ""Super Metroid"" in many ways.  However, there are several distinctions.  For starters, this takes place AFTER ""Super Metroid"" and adds a new wrinkle to story by creating a new nemesis called 'parasite X' which was able to procreate after our hero, Samus, wiped out all of the Metroids on SR 388.  This parasite is a menace to the entire universe and all traces of it on SR 388 and the orbital research lab must be destroyed.  ""... Fusion"" takes place entirely aboard the orbital research lab and employs most of the same gameplay that ""Super Metroid"" did.  It's still a side-scroller and it presents many of the same obstacles of its predecessor.  There are numerous different types of doors that are sealed and unable to be accessed unless certain criteria are met.  There are other access points and hidden entries that can only be discovered if you have the right weapons or know where to look.  In addition, throughout the game, there are several different bosses Samus must defeat in order recover certain powers.

It's hard to truly describe how satisfying this game really is.  You really need to play it yourself to see first hand.  Rest assured, though.  If you liked ""Super Metroid"", you're going to love this game.","All the fun of ""Super Metroid"" with great GBA advancements",1038268800,34,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Graphics - Let's face it, the ds isn't known for it's graphical quality, especially when it comes to 3D.  But these graphics are great.  They aren't as good as todays standard consoles, but I don't recall any N64 or Playstation game looking this good. Best out there right now for the DS so I give it a 5/5.

Control - Control with the stylus takes a while to get used to, but once you get the hang of it it's a lot like using the mouse for a computer.  If your left handed don't worry because they have a special setting made special for you guys.  If you still can't get use to the stylus then you can use the buttons for aiming. 4.5/5

Sound - If you've heard the music from the original metroid prime then you've heard the music to this game.  Sometimes can be very intense to build up suspense of what's going to happen.  4/5

Replay Value - Just like the other metroid prime games, you have a log book.  Playing through the first time, you can ignore this, but filling it up to 100% can be a challenge.  You also have energy and missle expansions.  Single Player mode is pretty short though.

As for the Online, this is an excellent feature.  There's a battle mode and you can chose from any of the character's you have beaten.  This can provide for hours of fun.  You can also create friends and rivals who you can compete with in 7 different forms of battle.  You can also text and voice chat with your friends which was unbelievably clear.  I could understand every word when I tried this.  (with Online) 5/5

Fun Quality - I personally got bored with the previous metroid prime games with the gamecube, but for some reason this one is different.  Maybe it's the online maybe it's the two screens and touch screen, I don't know, but i think what it is is that it's more action orientated and I love action.  5/5

Buy or Not - I haven't always liked shooter games like this, but I really enjoyed this one.  I would reccomend to BUY.

Graphics:  outstanding.... they really are!  while the cutscenes look like the rest of the game, not CG like FFX, it helps maintain the disney mood, which is what the goal is
Sound:  well, Disney of course!  all the different worlds you visit (little mermaid, nightmare before christmas) have their own background music from the movie, to include intense boss battle music
Voice Acting:  they really took alot of time to get this one right... FFX got alot of people all crazy over this stuff (they still have the mouths moving to japanese words).  great talent, original Disney actors (IMPORTANT), and synched up with the mouths
Combat:  no turn based or time based battles like Square's other projects.  this is more hack'n'slash with magic mixed in.  good mix, actually, since you get different moves over time
Control:  this one is kinda fishy, since the camera comes into play here.  the controls are pretty tight, as you dodge roll and glide everywhere.  BUT....... jumping is he*l, especially in tight corners!  you can only adjust the camera so much and you'll get kinda frustrated with it.  very small drawback when compared to everything else though
All in all, this game features alot of stuff to keep you in the mix.  you're always looking forward to that next world to go to, or that next ability you can get that lets you open up treasure chests in past worlds.  OR, you looking forward to fighting in the next coliseum battle and getting the ultimate weapons for everyone.  Square never lets us down with all these side quests, many of which are essential to finishing the game.  for those of you who just love to level up and get your characters to level 1 million with a gadzillion experience points, this one's for you too.

5.0,False,"01 24, 2008",A19SE2ZAH016LT,B000X25GW2,Whisper,"First of all, this is a mature title and it's a welcome change of pace from all the ""casual"" games out there on the Wii. There is blood and mature language, but it's in the style of of what you may have seen in the Kill Bill films. This game is totally over the top and it's funny.  It's all about the intense combat, strange characters, witty dialog, wicked sense of humor and overall visual anime-style look of the game.

There are tons of combat maneuvers you can perform with the Wiimote and Nunchuck.  Make sure to do the beginning tutorial as once you are done, you will have the controls figured out.  The combat is a mix of sword fighting with wrestling type maneuvers (Suplex, Piledriver, Powerslam, etc).  The combat never gets boring due to all the variations and moves you can perform (and upgrades). You can charge up your sword swings, stun, block, evade, grab and throw along with combos. It's incredibly refreshing and fun.  When you defeat an enemy using a finishing move, little slots at the bottom of the screen start to spin (like a mini jackpot machine) and if you match three slot icons, you will go into 1 of 5 special uber modes for a short period of time. Very cool and different.

After defeating the first boss (shortly after the beginning tutorial), you won't have enough money to pay the Entry Fee of the next Boss fight. So, you will have to do side-jobs, free fight and assassination missions to earn money. You drive your motorcycle around the city to get to the various jobs and missions and stores.  I want to point out that this ""over world"" is strictly to allow you to get from mission to mission or various shops and it's not intended to be like Grand Theft Auto where it's an open ""sandbox"" where you can do anything you want. But, after defeating the second and third bosses, you will find that there is a lot to do in the city as quite a bit is opened up to you by then.

You can customize your character by going to the clothing store (named Area 51) and purchasing new T-shirts, Jackets, Jeans, Belts and Sunglasses.  You can purchase beam Katana upgrades or different types of Katana's from Naomi's lab. You can upgrade your character by learning new wrestling grapple moves (learn by renting videos). There is even a fitness club where you upgrade your strength, health and amount of combos you can pull off. What is unique is that it makes you do all the training movements like lifting the Wiimote and Nunchuck as if they are fitness equipment (Dumbbell, Squats, Bench Press and more).

There are a few hidden items to find by exploring the environment such as  Lovikov Balls (used to increase your abilities at a trainer) and money.

You can go back to your motel and just hang out and put on different clothing and watch videos (first one available is the original trailer for the game). You can go to the video store (Beef Head Video) and purchase other videos.

Definitely check this game out. NOTE: After you defeat the second boss, a lot of stuff opens up for you to do in the environment - basically, the game keeps giving you more to do after each boss - you will not get bored.  This game has style and personality and you will have not played anything like this before. It's that original.

The premise and the gameplay itself are so much fun and so deliciously weird, and it's something I would've never imagined myself in a million years. It's not a bunch of reading, you don't need a 592 page strategy guide, and you don't need to play the game for 40 hours just to unlock a bunch of crap before you can do anything.

If you're curious as to what is so weird and interesting with this game, a lot of it has to do with the general weirdness of Japanese culture, as this game both visually and conceptually seems like it was taken out of a Japanese kids cartoon. The music is left as is, and all the songs are sung in Japanese, which really does a lot to add to the intrigue and otherworldliness that's consistently present. The dialogue also feels like it was almost purposefully translated as literally as possible to add to the goofy atmosphere, which in effect has made the King of All Cosmos one of the most beloved video game characters ever. And finally, the idea behind the gameplay, which consists of rolling up random objects (emphasis on random) in proportion to your katamari ('ball' or 'clump' in Japanese) and building it up in size as quickly as possible, seems like something that was yanked out of a child's warped imagination.

There are plenty of reviews here that explain the premise and the mechanics of the gameplay more in depth, but the main thing I want to convey is the sheer amount of fun and the bizarre atmosphere this game creates. It is completely unique and a world of its own, and is really worth picking up.","Completely unique, a world of its own, incredibly imaginative",1143676800,7,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

I was forever anticipating getting this game. This iteration fills in the storyline quite well. If you start out venturing into KH with this game then you will be lost as far as the story goes. This particular game includes Kingdom Hearts 3D - Dream Drop Distance which was released for the 3DS back in 2012, Kingdom Hearts X Back Cover, and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep 0.2 A Fragmentary Passage. If you consider yourself a diehard Kingdom Hearts fan and would really like to invest in a serious commitment to following the story then here is a timeline of release that would need to be followed. --

- Kingdom Hearts  (PS2)
- Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (Game Boy Advance)  ~OR~ Remade into a PlayStation 2 game with 3D graphics and additional features titled Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories
- Kingdom Hearts II (PS2)
- Kingdom Hearts Coded  (made for mobile phones)  ~OR~  Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded (Nintendo DS)
- Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Nintendo DS)
- Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep (PSP)
- Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance (Nintendo 3DS)
- Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix  (PS3) HD remakes of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and Re:Chain of Memories and HD remastered cinematic scenes from Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, This title is also avail on the PS4 remastered in HD and includes Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix
- Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix  & Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix (PS4)
- Kingdom Hearts  (PC)
- Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix (PS3) HD remakes of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix and Birth By Sleep Final Mix and HD remastered cinematic scenes from Kingdom Hearts Re:coded.
- Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue (PS4)  Actually just a HD remake of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance  ~ALSO~ Includes Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth By Sleep: A Fragmentary Passage and a one-hour movie companion to Kingdom Hearts , Kingdom Hearts  Back Cover
- Kingdom Hearts III  -- In development for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

One should note that the KH III will be the first multiplatform release, as well as the first for a Microsoft console!!
Now I know that  if you are new to Kingdom Hearts that obtaining and playing all of these games at this point would be a gargantuan undertaking. So if you are just jumping in and don't want to start from the beginning, then I would just suggest getting at least the 1.5 & 2.5 for the PS4 ( avail as a combo on 1 disc) and then this title so that you have a good feel for this fantastic game!

 The graphics in this game Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 were very nice, Top notch I would say. And especially the cinematics in the hour long movie during the Kingdom Hearts Back Cover section, This movie's graphics was done 'extremely well'. The hour long movie is about what had happened pre Kingdom Hearts 1, and what happened before the Keyblade War which was mentioned in Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep.

  The only thing I was a little bummed about was the fact that the game can be completed in under 4 hours and that includes watching an hours worth of cinematics. A huge bonus to this game was the fact that two controls can be used simultaneously. And the fact that this story does a good job of filling in the gap between both Birth by Sleep and Sora/Riku's campaign and will lead us right into Kingdom Hearts 3.

5.0,True,"11 2, 2012",A2ORZYOH2IRT9W,B006MQH644,Jason Dodge,"This is easily the BEST collection of Xbox Live Arcade games that has become available on disc. Even at the original price of $40, paying for each of the 8 titles separetly would cost $100 on the Xbox marketplace (as of November, 2012) (and includeing the Rocketmen DLC). But currently you should be able to buy this for $30 new, and about $15-$20 used. Which means if you're thinking about buying one of the currently-priced games at $15 (either Bionic Comando: Rearmed 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo  HD Remix, or Flock) then you might as well consider buying this collection. The other five games in the collection are still priced at $10 on the marketplace, so even if only two hold your interest right now, you're still better off getting the collection. Even if Capcom had a huge blowout sale at 50% off, all these games would still cost you $50.

Each of the 8 games is the same version you'd find digitally on the Xbox marketplace, all the features, achievments, and multiplayer support is exactly the same, and players using this disc collection can easily play with those that bought the original digital versions. Plus you'll always have a physical copy of the game, even if Capcom desides to discontinue and remove any of these games in the future. Of course, you still need the disc in order to play anything.

  The High-Profile Games:
Bionic Commando: Rearmed 2 -- (currently still 1200 points on marketplace) The well-recieved sequal to the original digital remake of the classic NES title. This second game is unhindered by needing to be designed by the constraints of the original, and is favored amoung the fans, plus it adds 2-player coop through the whole campaign.

Super Street Fighter 2: Turbo HD Remix -- (1200 points) A faithfully reproduced HD version of one of the best fighting games around, and its online net code offers some of the smoothest online play for a series that is renowned and requires split-second timing.

Final Fight: Double Impact -- (800 points) Is actually two arcade ports in one, the original Final Fight and another Capcom action game, Magic Sword. Not only do we finally get the definative arcade port of Final Fight, both games have a number of visual options and settings. You can play the original version, add a bluring effect to smoth out some of the edges, add scanlines, and you can taper the edges of the screen like a real arcade cabinet (or combine some effects).

Flock -- (1200 points) It's kinda a strech to call this a ""high-profile"" game, but it is the only other game that still retails for $15, and I've NEVER seen it on sale since its release.  You basically heard sheep in the game, but its rather fun and addictive, and there's a good amount of content to keep you busy. If you were always curious about this game, but never thought it was worth the $15, then this collection is the BEST way to experience it.

AND THE REST?:
Super Puzzle Fighter Turbo HD Remix -- (800 points) is certainly worth checking out. It has fun, simple yet addictive gameplay the has graced the series for years.

Wolf of the Battlefield -- (800 points) is actually a direct sequal to the original Commando arcade series. Its the third in the series, and it tries to modernize the Commando-style action. Its not a horrible game, but its not a highlight of the package.

The rest of the games are enjoyable, but are mostly there to round out the collection. Rocketmen: Axis of Evil (800 points) can be a lot of fun, and you also get the DLC pack (worth 400 points) with it, so at least you get a good amount of content. 1942 (800 points) is a simple HD interpretation of the original acrcade classic.","This is $100 Worth in One Collection, Do Not Miss It",1351814400,9,,

No game before it and no game since then has managed to pull me so deeply into the story and have me hanging on every word like this one did. The characters, the music, the graphics, the story... it's all golden.
The characters are simply unforgettable. Cloud, Aeris, and Yuffie were my favorites of the bunch. Each character has such wonderful design, half realistic half cartoonish, full detailed backgrounds, and such personality and potential to develop that I enjoyed following everyone one of them.
The music and graphics sticks in my mind like nothing else. They worked so well together. From simple cut scenes to the most glorious of FMV. And unlike today's games that throw long boring FMV in just for the sake of filling 2 DVDs, this game used FMV to make a point so poetically you couldn't help but feel like you just watched an epic film.
I wish I could sit here and just ramble on and on about the beautiful story and the twists, turns, and major events, but obviously that would ruin it for any who still haven't played this masterpiece of a game. I see many, many people today who have never played a game like this and are simply enthralled by today's crop of PS2 RPG wanna-be's and it really irks me. They simply don't know what they've missed and 9 times of 10 simply don't care.
It may not have the 200 hours of today's games, but unlike today's games it's not freaking simulated boredom. It's 30 hours of FUN and story like you've never seen before. This game changed my perspective of how videogames could be, and is guaranteed a lifetime place in my favorite collection.

5.0,False,"02 18, 2017",A297R3JTTZITU,B01GW3POY0,Luis R.,"I rented this game from redbox and decided to marathon it until I beat it, and bring it back. This game is incredible! I've played Resident Evil since the original, so I wanted to see, what Capcom, brought to the table. They delivered in spades! You start the game as Ethan, a man that is looking for his wife, Mia, after he sees a video of her possibly in danger, mind you, she has been missing 3 years! You start on this long walk to the house. Which is where everything starts, and at the end, will go back to. The first person view for this game was the right choice! Everything you see, is right there. You have to pay attention to your health on the watch Ethan gets after losing his hand. Regular herbs heal slightly, but first aid bottles you need to stack up in order to get through the game smoothly.

The knife you get is alright. Once you get used to the controls, and what you are doing, it's easier to deal knife attacks to enemies to conserve ammo. You mainly deal with mold, creatures that won't go down easily unless you do some well placed headshots, or have, a strong shotgun. John is the main guy you deal with for a good chunk for the first part. What he does to the officer is awesome. But you will see him more than a few times. The grandma will give you some spooks, and you will realize who she is later. You scour the house looking for keys to unlock doors throughout the house. Cool weapons, grenade launcher, and shotgun, and, the flamethrower. The flamethrower is good for burning weak enemies, buying time, and needing light in dimly lit areas. I also tried to get the mr. bobblehead collection in one run, but had 19 out of 20 when I beat the game. Also, you get antique coins. This will let you gain steroids to increase your health, stabilizers to increase your reload speed, and the magnum which I suggest you save for the last boss on her final form. You find magnum bullets more near the end. But, I chose to save them for the very last battle and around 8 rounds to her mouth quickly got me the Albert gun to kill her and beat the game.

The graphics are great! I used a hisense h8 tv on 4k with game settings. Although I have a ps4 original, I have HDR enabled and made the game look better. On the pro, it must be much better. I also played this game in the dark. Doing so, I had to raise brightness in the game settings. It helped more due to the color, and items that are well hidden which isn't easily visible. Psychostimulants helps with this, but in my first run of the game, I had found a total of 8 of them. It will take strategy to beat John in his final form as well, but its fun. Also you do make a choice near the end to save Zoe, and Mia. What you choose changes the ending of the game so choose who you want to save although, the choice is obvious. I didn't get to try madhouse mode, but playing this first run has made me want to buy the game. I've had a  great time with it. It has given me moments which spooked me.

The audio is fantastic, I had to take breaks in order to think on what to do next. This is one of my favorite Resident Evil games now. Later in the year, I want to get PSVR, and this game to play together. Capcom has really done it with this game. I was also excited to see Chris Redfield in the ending. I hope the next Resident Evil is like this. The story here comes full circle in the end. You get to play as Mia. The flashback VHS tapes are a cool touch. Especially, the happy birthday tape. I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan, or wants a weekend to play. It took me about 2 days. This can be finished on a weekend.

It's got great graphics, a compelling story line, tight controls, and is just plain fun to play.  If you have a PS3, consider picking up the disk with both God of War 1 & 2 on it.

In GOW you taken on the persona of a Spartin who committed a horrible act and has been trying to wipe the slate clean and remove  his tortured visions by serving the gods.  You don't know much about his history when things start, but you learn his story in dribs and drabs as you go.  The story is compelling and it makes you want to keep going a little further to learn more.  Your situation ultimately compells you to try to defeat the God of War.

One thing GOW is not though is a kid's game.  Unless you have a really mature kid, you should probably not be letting your kids play this game until they're at least in their mid-teens.  In addition to the violence, of which there is pleny, there is also frontal nudity (toppless) and one mini-game where you are pleasuring two prostitutes.  If it were a movie, GOW would be R or NC17.

The mechanics are pretty straight forward for a PS2 game.  You have attacks, blocks, jump, etc.  You have to do some puzzles from time to time and there are a fair number of button pushing mini-games where pushing the correct sequence makes you pull off some cool looking cinematic move.  Sometimes these are optional and just make a battle easier, but often they're required to win a fight.  Many games have copied this feature and a lot of times they will make you concentrate so hard you miss the cool moves on screen (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leisure-Suit-Larry-Magna-Cum-Laude/dp/B00023B1SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</a>), but GOW is pretty forgiving on the timing to press the button so it never really frustrates you too much.  Even when it was difficult, I considered it to be fair and not cheap.  I also never really had much trouble figuring out where to go next.

I can't encourate you enough to give this one a try.  It's got decent length, minimal annoyances, and no major bugs I could see.  Really a top of the line title and well worth the minimal price you'll pay to get it.",A Must Buy for PS2 Owners,1269907200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Because I knew that GT3 was going to be the best.  This game has the most realistic graphics.  The cars look VERY real.  Especially in the replay mode.  You can see heat waves coming off of the ground, real time reflections coming off of the cars, the backgrounds are really GOOD and they actually have real world locations(my Dad came in when I was playing the Rome level and he said he was in the same exact street I just drove in), and see what it's like going 130 mph! But one thing you may notice is that you don't get ANY car damage at all.  You can hit all the cars as much as you like, but you bounce off them like bumper cars.  I guess they did this because the car companies didn't want their cars to look bad.
They call this a ""realistic driving simulator"" and it is....kinda.  See, I asked REAL drivers to play this game and they said it wasn't, even when they played on the steering wheel. See, the thing is, each car has it's OWN FEEL to it.  So not every car handles the same...just like in real life.  And also, you can hear the differnt engine sounds each car makes.
Some people might not like this game because of the control...and I admit, it takes a while to get used to.  This isn't arcade style driving, it's a simulator.  That means you can't go 130 around a corner, you're going to have to slow down when going in, and then accerlate while going out.
In the game, there are two modes, a simulator mode and an arcade mode.  In the sim. mode, this is where you have to make a living on racing.  You start out with a certain amount of money, buy a car, and let the racing begin.  When you win, you get more money.  With this money, you can buy parts for your car, and believe me, you can just about buy almost anything you can buy....engine, shocks, breaks, tires, seats....and more.  You can also get a NEW car, and get a car wash.  What you can also do is test out your car.  In the arcade mode, you are given some cars, and a certain amount of levels.  You get more levels by getting 1st place in each level.  But just because it's an arcade mode doesn't mean the control is differnt.  One thing I like about the control is that it uses the pressure sensitivity on the dual shock 2. The harder you press, the faster you go.
The soundtrack is also nice, and the game has a nice replay mode after each race, which you can also custimize for your own taste.  One of the games faults that you may notice is the weak AI. That doesn't mean you'll win easily it just that when the race starts, all the cars immedatly go into a single file line.  But the game doesn't cheat on you, at least I haven't noticed any cheating. But this game will take a long time to fully complete.  You can finish the arcade mode pretty quickly but the sim. mode is the core of the game.
You don't have to be a hardcore racing fan to appreciate this game and have fun.  This is also a great game to show off your PS2 with, and it's certainly the best looking game out for the system right now.  Just don't expect it to be very easy and jumps, and catching big air like in Crazy Taxi.",This is the racing game i was waiting for!,997315200,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

DoAD is an awesome edition to the Dead or Alive series. I've been a huge fan since the beginning of the DOA series.

The 3DS edition is by far the heftiest version in terms of added gameplay. From Tag Challanges, Arcade, the new Chronicle mode, Verses (Online&Local!),Survival, to the showcase, street pass, spot pass (receive free items from Tecmo!!) and taking pictures of figurines you'll collect in 3D.
If you've been a fan since beginning too, you'll instantly recognize alot of the cutscenes that are in the new Chronicle mode. I was very very happy to see them again, giving me great nostalgia of the good ol days. The cutscenes are shared along with the in-game graphic (which are beautiful 3DS graphics) cutscenes as well that move along the story, however, for whatever reason by Tecmo, are very static. I really don't mind this, but it would of been nice to see a little more interaction by the characters. The fmv cutscenes more than make up for this, in my opinion, because I couldn't get enough of how much they were putting into this from the previous series. Again, if you've been a huge fan as I have, you'll instantly recognize every scene being played out from the previous games.

Internet is where its at ofcourse, taking your skills online. I've had a great experience, mainly lag free, but I have had instances where there was lag to heavy lag, however we can't always expect perfect connection. It was only a few matches, so nothing to worry about. I'm quite happy with online mode. I haven't done any local yet. And I believe challenges for coop online, are only by friend. So if anyone wants to play coop challenge, please let me know! We can exchange codes.

Arcade isn't what is used to be on previous DOA. I think some might be turned off by this fact, but I understand this decision because of Chronicle mode, there seems to be no point to add a story in Arcade as previous DOA installments. In Arcade, you just go thru the typically line of fighters, in what is known as ""Course"". There are 6 courses to go thru I believe, with each set of fighters to fight. Doing this mode unlocks your costumes and more figurines to collect. Again, there are no special endings scenes (or beginnings for that matter), because of Chronicle mode.

I do love the 3D on this game, its nice to see the beautiful rendered characters and background in 3D, along with the special effects that pop out at you.

If you have DOA or are planning to buy, WHICH it is a must buy, esp if you are a fan of DOA. Tecmo is releasing a costume download everyday until the 30th (of May) for each of the women in DOA, so if you haven't already, make sure your spot pass is enabled!! It'll be shown as ""DOWNLOAD 01"".

Every venue of the game which includes The Cavern Club, The Ed Sullivan Show, the Budokan, and the Rooftop of Apple Corps, is extremely accurate to the smallest detail.  Since The Beatles quit touring in 1966, Harmonix compensated for this with a unique approach.  For songs (I am the Walrus, Revolution, etc) that The Beatles released after they stopped touring, the band starts out in Studio Two at Abbey Road and then the game evolves into a magical dreamscape with flowing colors and images.

The Beatles themselves are also finely detailed to the smallest nuance.  One thing that particularly impressed me as a Beatle nut was the accuracy of the on screen guitar playing.  The computer generated Beatles actually play the same chords and in the same position that the actual song calls for.  The producers of the game could have just used generic hand motions and strumming patterns, but this extra small touch was much appreciated.  All of their actual movements are faithfully reproduced and at times it feels like you're watching the actual band as opposed to computer generated characters.

The song selection of 45 songs (the albums Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band will be released for download after release) is quite varied and diverse.  It covers their early career and goes through to their final songs.  One criticism I have is that there is only one song from Help!, but other than that the catalog is very well rounded.

Another critique I have of the bundle is the overabundance of plastic, stickers, and the lack of a good instruction manual for building the drums.  After I fully unpacked the bundle, it looked like a disaster area with a lot of excess plastic, cardboard, plastic wrapping, and stickers securing them to the box.  I am sure that they had a reason for this, but it creates kind of a headache.  The instruction manual was generally decent, but constructing the drums was difficult.  Note to readers: the drums themselves were not complicated to construct, but if you went by the instructions you would be left wondering what to do next.  Some steps are completely skipped over.  So be prepared.

All in all, this is a fantastic game.  If you're a Beatles fan, casual or insane, you'll love it.  But this isn't the best for people who have never listened to The Beatles.  If you are already not a fan, this will not make you like The Beatles, but perhaps it would make you like them even less due to the high level of detail.  I will say though that novices and experts alike should find great enjoyment in this game.  One of the drawbacks for me on previous games of this nature was the level of time it took to get ""good"".  I have played real guitar for 13 years, but I sucked it up bad on Guitar Hero.  With this, the songs (I would recommend starting on medium for even the most rookie of players except on drums) are challenging, but the pace is such that it is easy for a newcomer to the series to blend in and become a member of the Fab Four.  You can play bass, drums, guitar, or sing.  The many choices make this a game that will keep you coming back.

In closing, the game (or bundle) is well worth it and it exceeds all the hype.  Any fan of The Beatles would be out of their mind not to own this.

The storyline is perfect, classic resident evil.  The age old tale of good versus the evil (and slightly demented).  Each character you meet has his own story, but it's not randomly thrown in there.  I can't even explain it on paper without ruining the experience for you, so I'll just say that the story is marvelous.
The game play is even better than previous RE's, with weapons from the old series and a few surprises.  I love the fact that there are weaons that come in pairs, so you can aim at two different enemies at once.  The levels are interesting to play, and I never feel ""ahh, I have to go all the way around there again?  I'm bored, why is this so long?!""
Speaking of length, this RE is also the longest I've played so far.  The game takes is time slowing bringing you into the world of survival horror.
The music is great, again.  There's a recurring theme in the story, and each time it is played it reminds you of previous scenes in the game... like a ritornello in a concerto, bringing you back into familar terrority.  I like what that does with the mood.
The opening move sequence immediatly brings you into the game.  And later scenes have equal quality sequences.  The facial expressions in the CG's have improved immensely, as well as the character's body position as they interact (no more ""I feel like chicken tonight"" elbows while Clare talks to Leon ^_^)
The only real thing I have to complain about is the terrible voice acting, but that goes with the RE territory, so I'd almost miss it if it wasn't there (it wouldn't be a B-movie like game otherwise!  It's almost classic now.)",Best in the RE Series yet!,1001808000,7,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

After all, it is made several months after the others, and as such, it probably may not just be a simple rehash/port of the DS/PSP game.

Guess what? It isn't.

From what you can expect by now, Michael Jackson: The Experience is a rhythm-based game featuring the King of Pop dancing in one of his many different music video environments. There are 15 songs in the game, and considering the price the game can go by now, that's a steal and already well worth the money!

=The following songs are:=
THRILLER (You may make your purchase now)
Beat It
Smooth Criminal
Bad
Black or White
Billie Jean
Leave Me Alone
The Way You Make Me Feel
Ghosts
Blood on the Dance Floor
Don't Stop Til You Get Enough
Remember the Time
Speed Demon
Rock With You
and lastly, the newly released single, Hollywood Tonight

And each and every song is amazing and fun to listen to. If you count this as a video game soundtrack, then this may as well be one of the best video game soundtracks ever.

Like a good rhythm game, the notes sync perfectly with the songs being played (at least on Medium and Expert mode). The gameplay itself consists of swiping the stylus to make lines or such to match with the notes of the song (Which are represented by what motion you must make with the stylus). One or two times per song will there be a Freestyle sequence (or maybe a video, or both), in which you could perform your own stylus swipes within a set time limit before going back to the sets of notes. Believe it or not, the game is actually pretty challenging in terms of difficulty, but doesn't feel hard enough to where it's brutal.

The graphics are really awesome. A virtual Michael has never looked any better than this, and he dances quite like his real self! On top of that, the different environments (all of which are faithful to the music videos for the songs) can be quite breathtaking to look at. They are even accompanied by neat little video scenes. Don't worry. They are far and few in each song, and hardly last too long. In fact....they rather end abruptly. And while turning up the 3D makes the atmosphere all the better, I can't say the same for the video scenes. Still a great-looking game, though!

While you can play through all the songs within an hour and a half, the game actually leaves you with a variety of challenges you can face as you play. Beating the challenges can lead to unlocking things like trophies, special gloves, alternate outfits, and dynamic effects that make the song's atmosphere prettier.

I was initially displeased with the fact that Michael was dancing all by his lonesome (with the exception of Speed Demon), but unlocking the dynamic effects actually kinda make up for it. While the neon silhouettes of what are supposed to be backup dancers are pretty lame, you can also unlock touches like bopping cardboard cutouts in Leave Me Alone, papers flying through the wind in Billie Jean, ghosts flying around in Ghosts, and some songs even have an unlockable crowd in the background. While I somewhat still wish some effects (like the crowd) were set up without unlocking them, the challenges certainly make for decent amounts of replay value.

As great as this Michael Jackson game is, it still has a few obvious flaws. First, there's the lack of legit backup dancers like I already mentioned, but there's also the fact that there is no campaign. You just freely select the songs and dive into them. It would be nice if it were more like a normal video game would be - (EX) The 15 songs could just be set up in an order and as a row of songs is cleared, another row could be available, or something like that.

But all in all, Michael Jackson is an inexpensive must-have for the 3DS. It's also probably one of the better casual games for the handheld.",A rhythm-based 3DS thriller (pun intended)!,1369872000,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I love the sturdy feeling from it and each key feels as great to touch as my cherry red mx switch keyboard I've been using for gaming before this. The key difference has got to be the sound of the keyboard as this one is much quieter than my cherry red mx switch one.

As far as keys go the ones available are the normal buttons you'd expect with a num pad on the right. There are no macro keys on this keyboard so if you're moving from a different Logitech gaming keyboard you may find that you miss those. The lighting is awesome though and the cost of this keyboard is considerably low considering it's a mechanical one with RGB lighting.

This isn't too surprising considering Mass Effect was created by Bioware, a firm synonymous with the best RPGs of the last decade. The story and interaction in Mass Effect is superb, and the freedom of action and choices it allows is amazing. The voice acting is amazing, it is at times more like playing through an interactive blockbuster than a video game. They story contains a good number of sci-fi clichs but it carries them off so well you stop noticing very early into the game. Like a good RPG should, Mass Effect draws you effortlessly into the game from start to finish. The interactive experience is superb.

The controls are rather easy to master, and while the AI and combat suffers at times, it doesn't grow old or stale. The ability to modify and customize your weapons, armor and characters is easy but rewards and keeps things fresh. The ability to move all upgrades from one piece of equipment to a new one is also a nice time saver. The difficulty settings are spot on. Almost anyone can play through the game on the easy setting without much difficulty, enabling everyone to enjoy the cinematic masterpiece. For the more hard core and combat intensive the Insane difficulty is a good challenge. I picked up Mass Effect not sure if it was even possible for a game to live up to the hype it has received.

This is one of those games where right from the very beginning, you're treated to a cinematic experience that few other games have managed to emulate. Things happen in this game that you won't be prepared for storywise and just that in itself is reason to give this game a five star rating. I was really, really impressed with the story decisions that developer Infinity Ward made with the single player campaign. Very few games have left me as awestruck as this one did and even though it's a bit on the short side, you'll be witness to a bunch of moments that will leave you with your jaw on the floor, guaranteed.

The multiplayer portion is utterly fantastic, providing the player with an insanely deep character customization for a first person shooter. Up to 18 players can go at it online and the result is equal parts fun, mayhem and sheer action. I'd put this one up there with the best online multiplayer games of all time as this title won't be disappearing from the radar anytime soon.

I was a fairly big fan of the original, and even though the second was hated by most PC gamers, I actually quite liked it.  Prior to it's release, you heard nothing but good things about the newest Deus Ex and one such story told that the PC version wasn't just a direct port.  With that in mind, I pre-ordered the game on Steam and began playing two nights ago.  After putting over 10 hours or so into the game, I feel that I can give an honest impression on how it's gone so far.  So, without further adieu, my thoughts on Deus Ex: Human Revolution.

If you have played any of the previous Deus Ex games, you know what to expect.  There's a lot of heavily modified humans which gives them an almost superhero like powers along with big corporations and shadowy corporate agendas.  The game actually takes place about 25 years prior to the first Deus Ex, so the world is a little more chaotic.  Human modification with bionic arms and other such devices is a bit of a hot button issue.  On one side, you have scientists and corporations citing the life saving ability while on the other side you have purists who claim it's against human nature.  Throw in some socio-economic issues and the world is rife for chaos.

You play as Adam Jensen, head of security for a company call Sarif Infustries.  This company is one of the forerunners in human mechanical augmentation and as a result suffers an attack on the eve of a big announcement the company was going to make.  In the scuffle, you are nearly killed only to be brought back with an insane amount of modifications.  From here on out, you are equipped to find out who called the hit in on your company (and as a result caused some personal strife for Adam) and bring those people to justice.

As in other Deus Ex games, you are given a lot of choice in how you want to complete a mission.  Do you run through the front door guns blazing or do you sneak in through the back?  You can also play the social game and try to talk your way into places.  All are an option thanks to the mechanical augmentations you have built into your body.  Every level you will gain a point to put into these augmentations improving some and opening up others for the first time.  The way that the developers built this system is seamless.  You acquire the points at specific XP intervals as well as through buying them (although in limited supply) from stores.  Early in the game you may feel a little under powered, but thankfully you get points to place soon enough and the badassery begins.  Hacking was something I found I needed early on to complete some of the early side quests, so a little protip is to invest in 2 or 3 of hacking as soon as you can.  From there the choices are yours and they really are plentiful.  I always find myself anxiously looking forward to the next point I'm going to receive to try out a new power or improve upon one.  It's very addictive and you can see your character becoming better and better as time goes on.

In Deus Ex, you can focus on Stealth or Gunplay or also a mixture of the two.  I'm going for the mixture.  I'm finding that stealth is amazing and really fun.  On the PC, holding the right mouse button sticks you to a wall in third person perspective giving you a wide view of the area.  I'll take people out in the shadows as much as I can, but I also carry some weapons for when things inevitably go hairy.  Stealth is so fun because of the tools that are given to you.  You can approach someone from behind and perfom a quick stun or kill move to silently remove the enemy from combat.  Be careful though, because if you only stun his buddies can wake him up and they will be alerted to your presence.  Pull the body aside to avoid this and hide it well, just like you would in a Metal Gear Solid game.

Gunplay in DE:HR is nothing to scoff at either.  It can be just as fun running from cover to cover mowing down enemies with your weapons.  Weapon mods and augs that improve gunplay are a plenty so you can always tweak what you want to do or become.  The mix of stealth and gunplay has been a blast so far and I'm really enjoying it.

The graphics in Deus Ex: HR are fantastic.  The world has a very golden glow to it which sort of reminds me of a Blade Runner type world.  There are some long load times between areas but they don't happen that often and I did find myself forgetting about the issue as time went on.  I played this game on the PC with max settings and it was amazing.  I haven't seen the console versions so I can't really speak to them.

One thing I typically don't touch on in first impressions is music but in this case, I think I have to.  The music is hauntingly wonderful with a touch of despair.  When the action gets heavy, the music reacts and really blends into the background while at the same time being ever present in your mind.  The music reflects the mood and at times even caused some anxiety about what's around the corner.  They did a great job with the music and a soundtrack wouldn't be a bore to listen to.

One final note about the game that really impressed me - the level of detail with the story.  Everywhere I go there are emails, PDAs, eBooks, etc. waiting to be picking up/hacked and read.  If you are a story nut like I am, you are going to have a field day.  The story is very throught out and doesn't treat you like a dumb consumer.  You will have no idea what some of the story items being referred to are at first, but remember them and it will pay out.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution can easily be categorized as a candidate for Game of the Year.

  For starters, this is quite possibly the best game ever made for the PS2. It has a completly real feel even if it includes very mature content. I will do my best to give the pros and cons.

Pros- boy, is their a lot of them.  The reason I bought this game is because it has the most realistic feel about it. It includes huge cities to quiant towns. Rockstar(the maker of the game) models most of the scenery to real places in america, from Nevada's desertous feel to the streets of LA. Altough just having such a realistic map that covers a vast area, it's more about the ability to control your character. You can take him to many different shops, Including 3 different clothing lines, a baber shop, a tatto shop, different types of gyms, Fast-food places that serve burgers, pizza, and chicken, clubs, bars, and casinos, all with mini-game like pool, poker, and dancing, gun shops- which are nessesary for the violence in the game, you can even go into police staions, Airports, and hospitals. Whats more is that by doing this you can have a different effect on your character, like becoming fat or thin. In doing such you gain attrubuites like respect, stamina, muscle, sex appeal, weapon skill, driving skill, even the ability to dive underwater.  Not only can you buy different things, but you can drive boats, cars, and fly airplanes. The missions are just the cherry on top. They have belivable charcters, even with the outlandish storyline.

Cons- there is only one problem I had with this game- the graphics. The characters regulaly look like blocks or squares. It's easy to get over that.

  So, in essence, if you are over 18, and don't already have this game, BUY IT!!",Just scratching the surface... GREAT GAME!!!,1175385600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In video games, I especially like First Person Shooters, and COD4 has to be considered one of the best available right now. It's graphices, sound, story and voice acting are all very, very good. It falls down in the single player game in being too short, and too scripted and linear compared to Crysis, for example, but is still challenging, varied and enjoyable. One of the features that bothers me is that if you don't advance during the course of a battle to where the designers think you ought to be, you can plan on the enemy spawning endlessly. I'd really like to see that changed in future iterationsto allow a different approach to a battle.
The multiplayer game, although it borrows the maps from the single player games, is another experience altogether. Be prepared for hundreds of servers with varied setups and maps, featuring A LOT of players, many of whom are VERY good at what they do (including my son). As a 65 year old, I can tell you that old age reaction times can be a challenge! I highly recommend this game.",Very entertaining in both single and multiplayer modes,1216598400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
5.0,False,"12 31, 2013",A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00AXI9X20,Where the Sidewalk Ends,"It's going to take a person more than just an hour of playing Disney Infinity to get the feel for just how much this set has to offer. This is far from just ""a game"". It's a LOT of games, all in one. To start yes, you can buy more characters later on as Disney releases them. But it's not like that's a bad thing. Each character holds a story mode game of their own for you to play. You buy characters if you want to buy more games. You don't have to if you don't want to. This set costs what it does because it's not just a single game, but a whole pack of them.

The graphics are stunning. In true Disney form, they managed to make everything so colorful and dynamic, it's like watching a really good movie. The game's background music is just as good. Each game mode and each character's story has it's own audio that matches the type of gameplay. They didn't use the same music for everything. From dramatic to playful, the audio changes to match what's going on all the time.

You can choose to play in several different ways. For each of your 3 figures you have a story game to play. It's not the same mission for all of them and you just pick the character you want. Instead, each of the characters has their own game to be played. This set coming with 3 figures means you get their corresponding games. Sully has a Monsters University game, Jack has a Pirates of the Caribbean game, and Mr. Incredible has an Incredibles game. All three of these story modes are different from each another and are designed with totally different types of gameplay.

In addition to the missions and story mode you can play with your figures, there's a Toy Box mode that has endless possibilities. This is where the game really shines. As you play through all the games, you collect items that you can use in the Toy Box. The Toy Box is an open world where you can create games and interactive environments for you and everyone else to play. This is where the ""infinity"" comes in. Just about anything you can think up you can create. The more you explore all Disney Infinity's games and missions, the more objects you'll find for using in the Toy Box.

You can also buy extras for the game, like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DISNEY-INFINITY-Power-Disc-Pack/dp/B00BT2BFQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DISNEY INFINITY Power Disc Pack</a>. These discs are used to give characters special powers and they unlock all kinds of items, vehicles, and themes for use in the Toy Box. The Power Discs come in random mixed packs, kind of how baseball cards do. You never know what you'll get. You can also buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/additional-single-packs-of-figures/dp/B00EC6W1O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">additional single packs of figures</a>&nbsp;to add more content and additional games play to with your set.

As a whole, this starter set is pretty amazing. Before getting it I wasn't sure about the price. After getting it and exploring everything it has to offer, the price makes sense. Just discovering hidden extras for use in the Toy Box is fun to do for hours at a time. There's even online capabilities where you can play against friends and their characters, and download other Toy Box missions/games others have created. The game's online and multiplayer capabilities are a little different for each gaming system. So be sure to check, if you have a very specific type of online gaming you would like to do, that the system you're buying it for can do it. If you have more than one gaming platform/system and you're trying to decide which one to buy this for, check out the Disney Infinity webpage where it outlines the games capabilities for each system.",Disney Infinity = Infinite replay,1388448000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii U'}",

Here are some of my thoughts after beating it:

GRAPHICS
This is probably the most beautiful of Zelda games. Especially after the horrible cartoonish look of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-Zelda-The-Wind-Waker/dp/B000084318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker</a>, the realistic textures in this game make this a beautiful world to explore. There are definitely places where one could just sit and relax, like the fishing pond. Also, the enemies and bosses all look awesome - they're invariably large, nasty looking creatures!

GAMEPLAY
The game includes some cool battle sequences and use of items. In some cases, you need to use a certain item or ride your horse to defeat a boss - but it never feels too forced. The battle of the Bridge of Eldin, with its jousting scene, is the best. The dragon in Skytown is also really cool. I wish you could replay some of those sequences and boss battles again - that's my only complaint about the gameplay.

GAME CONTROLS
I had some difficulty positing Link and getting him to do what I wanted, especially on the Wii because the A button does so much (sometimes you jump when you meant to grab). The more I played, the more I got used to it, but I think the 1 and 2 buttons could be been better used to add functionality (they just display the map).

PLOT/STORY
Generally, it's the same old story - Gannon is trapped in a dark world (Twilight in this case) and you need to defeat him and save Zelda. There are some cool twists and when you're playing you really don't know what's going to happen next (unless you read a spoiler review). Midna, a new character from the Twilight realm, is pretty cool. She has an attitude and helps you out quite a bit with hints.

MUSIC
Great, as always with the Zelda series. It doesn't have quite the power of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time/dp/B00000DMB3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, but it does fit really well with the game (especially the Hyrule Field at night theme).

OVERALL EFFECT
This is a great game, and it gets better the more you play. There's a lot of stuff to do. Even some of the side activities are fun, like finding bugs and Poe Spirits. It took me at least 60 hours of playing time to beat, and I want to go back and get all the items.

I never dreamed that a TV game could be so much fun, or that I would want to have one to play.  I wish my dad had lived long enough to find that he could still bowl, even thought he couldn't walk any longer.

I'm trying to get my mom one.  There are so many sports games which exclude a handicapped person -- but not when they can play Wii.  It is like you are actually there.

It is, IMO, the best game to come along in years.  I've heard that it is so popular in rest homes you have to book your time and game.  Even the children love it, they can -- and do -- beat their parents and grandparents -- and are actually learning how to play the games that are just too expensive to do.

Bowling used to be affordable, but not now.  Golfing has always been on the high side, so you wouldn't start your little ones off on a dangerous court at that price.  It is great to teach them concentration and ""to listen"" to the instructions at the beginning of the games, and as you go on.

It is  perfect give for a family of four.  The wonderful bonding in the family is very special.  It is also something that children do not want to lose the ability to play due to bad behavior, so if they lose a day it's hard, but if they lose two in a row, it tends to straighten them up very fast.

The games which come with the game are fun, and there are so many others you can add.  Christmas should be easier this year -- just check out the new games.

Add Tiger Woods Golf to the mix, and have fun.

5.0,False,"01 7, 2009",A2OD43W7EGDH97,B000Z9A95M,John Berger,"I don't even know where to begin because this game is so incredible!

I've been playing video games every since the days when the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 were brand new.  I am not exaggerating when I say that out my 25+ years as a gamer, ""Okami"" is in my top 3 favorite games of all time.

The Japanese watercolor design is gorgeous.  Clover Studios originally tried to use a more realistic, 3D-ish design, but the PS2 couldn't handle it.  The Japanese watercolor art design is so much more fitting and gives the game a style of its own.  It also makes it a much better fit with the incredibly rich story line and help to engross you in the Japanese history the is the root of the game.

Speaking of which, the story for this game is one of the best of any video game ever.  Japanese mythology just pours out of every scene.  There is a lot of reading to give you a much richer understanding of why things are happening.  I know that some people complain about lengthy cutscenes, but I didn't mind it at all.  They all added to the richness of the game and gave me an insight into Japanese mythology that I never would have otherwise experiences.

And the MUSIC!  The music is nothing short of phenomenal!  Simultaneously historical yet modern, Masami Ueda and Hiroshi Yamaguchi created a musical landscape for the game that's as rich as the game itself.  The combination of traditional Japanese instruments with traditional orchestral instruments is ... well, you have to hear it.  And there's a LOT of music to the game!  The soundtrack alone is 5 CDs!  (Sadly, it's a Japan-only release, so you'll have to pay a pretty penny if you want to import it, but it is availble through the game once you win it.)

The best part is that, unlike most games that give you 15 or 20 hours of gameplay, ""Okami"" can *easily* give you 60 or more hours of gameplay!  I love side quests because I love to feel like I've not missed anything.  So, I tried to complete as many side quests as possible.  My game save was clocked at over 80 hours when I finally won the game!  Yes, there really is that much that you can do!  I thought that I had completed a lot when I finished the first section, so much so to the point that I thought that I had finished the game.  (Again, 15 hours or so.)  Little did I know that I had finished about 1/4 of the game!

As far as I'm concerned, ""Okami"" is the pinnacle of story-driven, single-player, adventure gaming.  The combat is challenging; the story is incredibly rich; the music and graphics are nothing short of stunning.  This game is a complete delight to play.  No Wii or PS2 library should be without this game.",This game is a must-own for all Wii/PS2 owners.,1231286400,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

But she soon finds out that she can't escape the past that easily when she is beckoned one day by a ghost to return to her childhood home.  When Ann is abducted by a masked stranger it is up to Henry to unravel the past and save her.

""Lake House: Children of Silence"" is a nicely done hidden object/adventure game.  There are two levels of playing: casual (with a hint button that refreshes after 30 seconds and the interactive areas sparkle) and expert (with a hint button that refreshes after two minutes and there is no interactive help).  I played it in casual mode as I like to relax while playing games.  The animation is so-so at the beginning of the game but gets better as the game goes along.  The storyline is a great one and held my interest throughout.  The game is a nice mixture of puzzles and hidden object games.  The puzzles were challenging but not too difficult.  The hidden object games are nicely done - sometimes you have to move something or put something together to find the object.  There is a map - not the best map I've seen in games like this but it is very handy in letting you know which locations you can work on.  The music is a nice background for the game.  The game itself has just the right amount of creepiness without being too scary.

5.0,False,"02 25, 2008",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00002SVWG,Tsanche,"Final Fantasy Tactics, originally released in early 1998, went on to be one of Square's most critically acclaimed games of all time as well as becoming one of the mostly highly sought after Playstation titles until it was released as a greatest hits title. As the years go by, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the few games where reception of the game has increased over the years rather than decrease.  Despite having a reissue on the PSP, the original game is still a treat.  However, both versions have their own cons.  While many have reported that the PSP version has slowdown, the original Playstation release suffers from a mediocre translation of a fantastic story.

Final Fantasy Tactics concerns itself with Ramza Beoulve.  A noble who believes in justice and honor.  In the world of Ivalice, Ramza is about to be involved in the biggest power struggle in the world's history.  It concerns a conspiracy bigger than anything Ramza could imagine.  The story is full of almost everything you can imagine.  Betrayal, injustice and some of the most mature themes Final Fantasy has ever dared to go to.  Be forewarned, though.  Despite a T-Rating, the game is actually quite dark.  Despite it's cutesy graphics this game is anything but cute as it is easily the most violent and moving of all the Final Fantasy games.

The gameplay that makes Final Fantasy Tactics a treat. Thanks to the job system, customization is nearly endless. Before each battle you can assign jobs to your characters. Each job has specific traits about them and can greatly affect how you perform in battle. Mages have devastating magic abilities while Knights are strong physical attackers. They also bring their own unique abilities to the table. Because there are so many job classes to choose from, there's a lot of experimentation you can do. As you master abilities you'll also be able to mix and match. You could have a Squire casting white magic, for example provided you've learned some of the white magic abilities.

As battles progress you gain experience. You pretty much gain experience after each and every turn, which is nice. Not only do you gain experience but you also gain job points to help you master the abilities in your job class. It's pretty simple stuff and you'll be surprised at just how fast you can learn abilities here.

However, Final Fantasy Tactics was notorious for being an incredibly challenging game.  In order to survive some of the games toughest battles you'll have to spend hours roaming around to learn abilities and raise levels.  Enemies don't let up and they actually are quite smart.  They'll take advantage of your parties disadvantages by usually attacking the weakest character or even ganging up on certain characters.  It's also no help that their attacks deal a startling large amount of damage.  If you want to survive in Final Fantasy Tactics, level grinding is a must and it's not negotiable.

In terms of graphics, Final Fantasy Tactics is fairly cute looking.  But the sprites are incredibly detailed, especially for 1998.  Unlike the PSP version the game also runs smoothly and fast.  There are also a few cutscenes here and there to show you some of the story.  Tactics also sports some of the best music the series has ever known.

If there was anything to criticize about the original release it would be the same thing that everyone criticizes.  The translation is absolutely horrible.  The story is incredible, but the script for the original Playstation version may be one of the worst efforts done in localization history.  It's almost worth it to pick up the PSP version of the game for this one reason alone.  Some of the translation is so bad some parts of the story are utterly confusing.  The only other problem with Final Fantasy Tactics is that if you really want to get through the game, you'll spend the least amount of time taking in the story.  As I mentioned earlier, level grinding is a must to survive throughout the adventure.  The problem is you'll have to do it too much.  To the point where it stops the advancement of the story.  Sometimes for long intervals at a time.  And the story hardly retreads or reiterates events.

Final Fantasy Tactics is easily one of the best games in the series.  It is not, however, for the beginner or the inexperienced Tactical Strategy game player.  For those who don't wimp out, however, Final Fantasy Tactics is rewarding.",Arguably One of the Greatest Final Fantasy Games Ever Made,1203897600,2,,
5.0,False,"01 6, 2004",A36MN5FJI5V7MZ,B00009VE6B,and1homerun,"Here's a quick summary:

Graphics: 10/10- Couldn't ask for better graphics. Movie to game (and vise-versa) transitions are great. You feel like you really are playing the movie.

Sound/Music: 9/10- Really good. Music always fits the mood and sound effects are great. The reason I didn't give a ten here is because it isn't perfect and Gandalf sounds like a Hobbit when he grunts (which happens a good amount).

Gameplay: 10/10- Fun as hell! Its hack-and-slash, but more complicated. Killing orcs (etc) never gets old, due to the fact that there are many sick combos to purchase with experence points and pull off. Co-op is great...this might have gotten a nine or eight if it weren't for the co-op mode. (The levels are the same, but you progress differently). As you go you will unlock many DVD-type extras such as concept art, interviews, and sound tests. There are also three hidden characters and two secret levels. Starts off slightly slow (Helm's Deep and The Paths of the Dead are the first two levels but also the worst...still good though)

Replayability: 9/10- It hasn't gotten old for me yet, even three months after beating every little bit of the game. The levels are unique and fun to go back to. Co-op will please you as long as you have friends and/or family to occaisonally play with. The only prblem is the long cutscenes that are amazing the first five times get old, usually you can skip them though.

AND1HOMERUN'S RATING: 10/10- If you like video games and/or the movies even the slightest bit you'll enjoy this. Gauntlet fans will be sucked in especially. Nothing to turn off younger players either, though it is rating Teen (due only to the fact that swordfighting takes place, though nothing graphic is seen). Use yyour judgement but I would say anyone over the age of 10 should be fine.

I just figured heck I've never missed a playstation platform so I bought it. I was worried as these videos said the screen isn't good and Borderlands 2 is bad. How wrong! This system is amazing! The Vita is very underrated and these are the best handheld graphics I've ever seen! Borderlands 2 looks pretty darn close to the PS3 version and plays great! It's the console experience on the go! And Minecraft and Resogun are great on it too just like PS4/3! The system feels great and the UI is super fast. Remote play is also amazing! You can play your ps4 anywhere in the world! Also ps now is out so PS3 games on vita anywhere! This system is truly underrated and this bundle is a great value. 9/10,Underrated System,1421366400,,{'Edition:': ' Borderlands 2 Vita Bundle'},

The end result is a game that, while probably not for every gamer out there, is worth a look by everyone.  You'll hear me talk alot about the strategy of the game.........simply because that is the path I took with it.  Other's may prefer a different way to play.  This is part of the games beauty and ingenuity.  Different players can make the game what they ultimately want.

The graphics are not going to break the mold, but that wasn't the developers goal.  For what was intended, SEGA hit the nail on the head.....which is to say a beautifully hand drawn game.

The gameplay is where it REALLY stands out.  As an avid player of Civilization on PC and a huge fan of tactics and strategy, this game gets all my cylinders pumping.  I love being able to plan out the battlefield, setting up ambushes, making the best use of the tools at my disposal, and ultimately destroying my enemy.  Check, check, and check.  For the people out there who tend to skip tutorials, you may want to run through this game's, as the idea behind the gameplay takes a second or two to sink in and you don't want to let it sink in on the battlefield.  Controls don't even come in to play really.  They are simple and to the point.......the real challenge comes not from quick button presses, but a carefully planned out mode of attack.  Sure, it's fun to wipe out all in your way............but sometimes discretion is the better part of valor, and a surgically cut path through the ranks can be just as effective, if not moreso.  And truthfully, if the game stopped there, it would be great, but adding in the RPG feature of leveling up, special traits, upgrading......  and I am in gaming euphoria.

Ultimately, this game is going to appeal to some and not to others, as is the case with any form of media whether it be movie, music, or video game.  If you like chess.  If you like Stratego.  If you like Civilization.  If you like Final Fantasy, Legend of Dragoon (to this day one of the most underappreciated RPGs), or RPGs as a whole.  Or if you never played any of these but enjoy the challenge of a well thought out, strategic game.  This NEEDS to be on your shelf.  As for myself, I need to stop writing this review so I get back to it.  I can only hope to see a franchise rise from this title, or at least several others along this style of gameplay.

Honestly, the last game Mario game I played that wasn't Mario Kart, Mario Party, or Super Smash Brothers was probably Super Mario 3 for NES. This game exceeded my expectations for it.

The goal of the game is generic; it's the same one that Nintendo has been following for a while it seems. Mario saves Princess Peach. However, Mario isn't known for it's plot. If you're looking for something with a great storyline, this probably isn't for you.

I admit, I was impressed by how colorful and bright everything was. I thought it would be more continous, where you beat a level and move onto the next one like in the classic version. Instead, you enter a level and collect the stars, and then leave and move on to another one that you choose. Eventually you have to enter all of the levels, but again, it's not what I thought it would be. At first I was put off, but I enjoy it now. I love how each galaxy is unique. One may be a bright sunny beach, while the next is a dark, gloomy swamp or haunted mansion. It kept me entertained.

It's a good game for all ages. My mom loves it, and so do the young kids in the family. However, if you have small children, you should take into consideration that Mario Galaxy can be challenging. The controls are hard to get used to at first. Some of Mario's actions I still can't get used to, like swimming. My one other compliant is about saving. There were time that I would end the game with 20+ lives, but when I started again I would be back to 4. I'm not sure if this is typical of Mario games or not.",Impressed,1233792000,2,,

However if driving is your thing Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is the one you want to play first. I found the driving mechanics better in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.  The Need for Speed Hot Pursuit story is not episodic and disjointed as Burnout Paradise.  The graphics in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit are far better that those in Burnout Paradise, (Think Infamous 1 verus Infamous 2 upgrade in graphics quality!)  Hyper Realism in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit comes at a price of making the cars harder to control for the novice to driving games.  If you want a driving game to practice and hone your driving skills on I'd suggest Burnout Paradise.  However after Burnout Paradise you must definitely buy Need for Speed Hot Pursuit since this game will definitely take your game driving skills to the next level.  This is a cops and robbers game of your dreams where you get to be a psycho crook or psycho police officer behind the wheel a lot like ""Dirty Harry!""

The night time driving is very convincing in its realism.  The game did not glitch much even during the fast paced racing scenes.  Like the real thing each car has its strong points and its not so strong points so doing well in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is always about having the right vehicle for the right driving challenge.  The game world is large enough with enough variation to keep things interesting.  At this price point buying Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is almost a non brainer if you like a challenging sophisticated driving game where the thrills do not easily get stale.  I do not drive in real life because; I have autism, cerebral palsy and other disabilities so I am a real jerk behind the wheel in this game.  I really enjoy all the trouble Need for this Speed Hot Pursuit game lets me get into.  The basic Crown Vic type police car rides just like the real thing.  It has a powerful engine but can be nimble only if you master its many quirks.  I don't want to include any spoilers so I will end this review by saying I enjoyed Need for Speed Hot Pursuit it takes getting used to but I like it.  You must understand that while I still have cerebral palsy and other disabilities I have played video games for over 2 years now. I'll never be good at video games but I do well on causal levels now and in some video games I survive nicely on Normal.  On one video game I won the game on Veteran difficulty.  I will never win a game on Insane difficulty.  I say this because; games I once said were extremely hard are a bit easier for me now.  Only game I can't play because it is too hard is Borderlands 2.

I played only in the easiest mode, as I like to kick back and enjoy all aspect of the game, from the scenes and settings, to the story, to the team action, and to the weapon. I don't care to be the most aggressive, meanest and coldest shooter. It took me about 10 hours or so to finish in the recruit mode.

The cold war story was intriguing, but a bit too fast to grasp all details the first time around. The prologue on the ship was a great start, which definitely got my adrenaline flowing! When finished with the game, an epilogue is available for actions on a jumbo passenger plane! There is also the arcade mode which one can keep score.

The graphics is still good by today's standard (2012), but not ideal for large TVs. 50-inch HDTV was fine, but putting it on a 1080p 125-inch projection and the details are fuzzy. The music is quite appropriate (when reaching climax of battle). The AI is quote good as the enemies can adapt and own team members can yield if I was aggressive, or take the lead if I was passive on most incremental battle advancements (e.g., room to room).

5.0,False,"03 29, 2014",A2R4NKQYUSERGK,B00FENJVOE,Nour Hanieh,"This review has been conducted by a Hardcore character - not a Softcore character. In Hardcore, once your character dies to anything - including lag and bugs, your character is DEAD and cannot be revived. Though you will keep whatever is in your stash and their achievements will be remembered in the Fallen Heroes tab. Softcore is for those who have soft skin and cannot withstand to take a real loss of their achievements on a single character. Another thing to keep in mind is Softcore will barely make players smarter - thus granting a large number of players who are not able to think properly about avoiding damage, balance between offense and defense, teamwork and approaching encounters.

Several things to understand about this game and the review. I'll make it short and cut to the point. Be careful of those who ranked this game BELOW 5 stars - at least this expansion. Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls campaign is short. You can finish it in less than 10 hours if you already have a level 60 and providing you are not getting rushed/powered through the Act(s). RoS sports only Act V and fundamentally brings many new features to the table. Those who only rated it because of certain desires that they're not getting is just a pure disappointment from their point of view without thinking thoroughly on how the game was amplified to the best of its mechanics.

Act V is not an Act to take lightly. It is a hard Act. Even on Expert level, the monsters will cream your character fast. Maltheal is considered one of the best Diablo fights in history that brings packs of punches, tweaks and phases. Since then, Blizzard has taken this feedback and will create more bosses with nice tweaks and phases to keep the player moving about and thinking hard about it.

So why is this a 5/5 stars? Because this game has been seriously amazing since patch 2.0. Blizzard have been listening to players and they've tweaked the game to where it is not only playable, but fun! The Adventure Mode is by far one of the best features Blizzard has brought to the table. The one bad complain I would throw at Blizzard is the uselessness of Blood Shards where I *must* gamble these shards in order to get a legendary - if I want to gamble them. I know Blizzard is working on few new features to use the Blood Shards on something else and I look forward to that. The Mystic is -passable- for now. I'm sure they'll tweak her to fit better use of our hard-earned work towards something useful and not random.

The Rifts are one of the best modes they've also implemented. The monsters are harder and sometimes we encounter many champions/elites all at once and we fight through the packs. Rift Bosses are also hard at a times, they sometimes punish the player pretty hard. I have been playing on Torment I since Day 2 from release and it has been really fun.

These are a great pair of headphones. They fit really well, removable mic (one down side is getting the mic out is a bit hard) there is a mute mic button.

Also there is a female voice audio que when you do anything like powering on, charging, or muting mic which is really nice. It tells you when fully charged, which you can tell by being red for charge and green for full charge.

I have to say other than the mic being hard to remove and making the ""amp unplug"" noise when pulling it out, the other negatives are the charge cable does not stay connected very well so its very hard to play while charging.

Anyone who uses a PS4 regularly knows the need for wireless charging, it's just something you have to have.
Regardless of that however, the PS4 controllers don't last as well as their PS3 cousins, especially for long periods of game play in Mordor, or Assassins Creed for example.
Enter the Energizer extra life pack - what a great add-on, in fact I can't believe Sony hasn't marketed their own!
Makes charging simple, even compared to my old push down dual charger which could get fiddly, you just drop in the slot.
The packs look big and feel a little weird initially underneath but do not impede any game play that I have used them for, so that's a big plus also.

The storyline is something you have probably heard before on the news.  Out of control regimes in the MidEast and potential anarchy in the old Soviet Union.  The two factors make for a very intense game.  I don't even know if game is an appropriate title for something so realistic.  Your mission is to stop a rogue government from getting their hands on nuclear weapons.  Obviously a big challenge for anyone.

If you have played previous Call of Duty games you know the quality that goes into the gameplay.  Never overly to difficult for a first timer.  Much of the combat is very similiar to previous COD games.  The objectives are always short enough to keep the player involved.  What sets this Call of Duty game apart from it's previous incarnations is the amount of realism that has gone into it.  The graphics and sound are so real that you could almost think your watching a movie....Actually more real than a movie.  The only thing that may be lacking in this games single player missions is the lack of co-op play and the overall shortness of the game.  Most will have it completed under six hours.  Of course you can always give it a try and a more difficult setting.

The online multiplayer is amazing.  To say the least I didn't expect it to be this intense.  From the moment you start an online challenge you are thrusted into battle.  The game seems to keep the online working in such a way that it seems incredibly realistic.  What I also enjoy about the online is that it allows you to rank up rather quickly but you must have enough skill to be an asset on the battlefield.  Online there are numerous different missions that keep the game extremely fun and fresh.  Although you won't have access to these challenges until you prove your abilities.  What also keeps it fresh is the ability to gear your soldier differently as you advance thru the online.  This game will definatley have people playing for many, many months.

If you enjoy shooter games and most importantly like realistic war sims then this game is for you.  The graphics are amazing, the environments almost look too real, and the sound sets this game apart from others that have flooded the field.  If you ever wanted to have an idea of many of the challenges that today's soldiers have to deal with then you need Call of Duty 4.

I'll also second what another reviewer said: get yourself this soft-shell case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002VPE1QG/ref=yo_ii_img) because the Vita+grip together fits perfectly.

The game is a lot of fun. I don't want to say much because I don't want to spoil it for other players. But I will say that the people that you meet in the game are fun and you will have the ones that you will like and those that you will hate.

Now right now I've been playing as the girl or Frey as the game has pre-set. Let me say that if you don't like the name you do have the chance to pick what you want but it can't be a long name like; Kaitlyn or Elizabeth. I do believe that even after you start playing there is a person in town that will ask you if you want to change your name. (I've only talked to that person once so I don't know if it's true)

Also on the topic of names you get to named the monsters you tame for pets, the name of your farm(s), and your spouse when you get married.

I love how when you are reading the dialog the characters do talk a bit and I LOVE hearing Vishnal's voice. ~~~ I mean if you love Vic then you will fangirl over him. Also the same with Leon's voice actor. Levi's voice from AOT...  ~~~

Anyways in this game you have to save these four Guardians (where I'm at) and in doing so you fighter their monster forms but once beat them you can go back later and try to tame them. But from what I've read it is very hard to tame them. At least I've been having a hell of a time trying to tame Thunderbolt- Dylas. (Sorry I keep getting off topic.)

The Four Guardians! When you do reach their area you will find a sign and when you read it it will tell you what level that you should be in hopes of having a better success rate. For me I'm always 5 to 10+ levels above it because when you fight one they take a long time to fight. It also helps when you take a monster along because during the fight the boss seems to go after them first, but it gives you and advantage to do as much damage before the monster faints.

I do believe that even after you finish the Guardians that any new place with a boss will tell you what level to be.

In the game though you have to make orders and do quest all the while you are trying to hook up with someone and in my case a boy.

What I find annoying about the game is eating these types of bread in order to learn cooking, crafting, ect... And getting a license to use an air ship, or to make your own weapons.

Perhaps because these games are shorter than GTA IV, they are more like games and less like the movie GTA IV was; I respect what Rockstar was trying to do there, but there were certainly some pacing and mission difficulty issues.
And while not much has changed as far as the difficulty goes--often escaping the police is more of the hard part--,the pacing has picked up to the point where you feel like you are playing something that maybe would have come just before GTA IV. Very nostalgic, brutal, funny, and un-PC across the board; The Lost and The Damned offers a more hardcore experience, including little side on bike gang fights that reminded me somewhat of San Andreas and the turf wars; The Ballad of Gay Tony is more eccentric, colorful, and more of a throwback even so; the colors are brighter, there is a lot more neon, the free jumping is back from the tallest building you can find......the characters are really strange, but the story, as in TLAD, is very amusing.

As always, there are lots of cool things to do; just driving around in the right car in the right weather with the right song can be fun in and of itself; Great new songs, TV shows, Radio Talk, funny billboards, great game cross references, and internet stuff. Gone for the most part are the annoying phone calls in the middle of a gunfight or the mandatory bowling date to move on.

Now if they could just move this game to a more colorful setting; I would love to see Rockstar make use of some of things you know it can already do....esp when you look back fondly on GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas.","2 Fun GAMES, 1 Great Deal",1261353600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

HD graphics, captivating story, great action sequence, mesmerizing soundtrack and awesome gameplay it kept me glued to the screen from start to finish. I have tons of fun playing TR. In total I have finished the game 4 rounds, 3 in hard mode and 1 in normal mode (when I first played the game). I couldn't get enough of the game so I amped up the difficulties and much to my surprise the hard mode is not that difficult at all.

I had a blast upgrading my weapons and survival skills throughout the game. The side challenge to collect various items in the game was a nice addition to the main gameplay. Love this new Tomb Raider which was rated M. I love the realistic killing, the gun fight, using the bow was also a blast for silent kill.

The japanese floklore theme that was used in the game was really interesting and eye opening. It was a pleasant surprised I must say. It adds the suspense and dark elements to the game. Really interesting. The traversing, jumping, hanging, rolling, shimmering gameplay was great as well.

Lara's ship shipwrecked near an unknown island, she and her crew survives the ordeal but escaping the island is a real challenge. Playing Lara exploring the entire island from the mountain top to the beach side is an exhilarating adventure.

The idea was fantastic and the execution was better. This is not a normal RPG where you just hack and slash, you have to scare the living hell out of the humans. You have to use your creatures' powers to scare the humans. And if you are a newb, you can press recommend in the selecting screen and you will get a tutorial. This game changed my life.

I knew all of those RPGs but didn't care to play them until Ghost Master came and made me start playing RPGs, one of the most controversial genres in our gaming society.

Speaking as a die-hard Final Fantasy fan, this game beats any other series hands-down. Imperfect, but still incredible enough that I've bought a copy for every friend of mine with a PS2. I can't even say I'm joking. You must play this game.

The story is incredibly intricate. Not only do you have the main plot arc, with its multiple side stories, plot twists, and deep meanings, but you also have a dozen or so minor arcs that you can explore on a day-to-day basis. Each is unique, fun, relatable, and occasionally gritty. But if the side stories are profound, the main plot is mind-bogglingly intense. Like, hooooooly smokes. It's wicked. (Be warned: it deals with a lot of mature themes, which is part of what makes it so epic.)

There is only one static character in the game, and that's the unnamed Main Character. Everyone else is a miracle of writing. The characters in SEES (that is, the MC's closest friends) are more human than most people in reality. They have deep emotions, well-developed backstories, and you fall in love with all of them.

Gameplay-wise, it's a standard turn-based game, although it has a LOT of interesting mechanics that make you think ""Whoa, that the developers even THOUGHT of that..."" For example, if you play too much, your characters get tired. I dunno about you, but to me, that's head-cockingly brilliant. If I were a dev, I'd never have thought of that.

Now for the cons...the music is, to put it generously, bad. You get used to the faux urban style eventually, but then the second semester begins. The theme for school in the second half of the game requires the use of cotton balls to keep your ears from bleeding all over the basement. Luckily, this is just one horrible song in a soundtrack that ranges from poor to meh. The battle theme, at least, is decent. And the second intro theme (""Burn My Dread"") is pretty catchy. I think it was the only intro before the ""FES"" was added, but I'm not certain.

My only other complaint is the lack of minigames. With clubs like Kendo or Archery, you'd think there'd be something to entertain you, but alas, it's just a text adventure there. Which sucks, because Kendo would be an awesome minigame.

Regardless, buy this game. Scroll up, click ""Add to Cart,"" and do whatever you need to do to have it at your doorstep within a week. If you have to rob a bank to get the 20, 30 bucks, then leave a note explaining to the authorities why you did it. They will not press charges. Go. Stop reading.

The game itself is intense.  Heart-pounding intense.  The very first firefight sets things off with rapid-fire action.  AI characters are intelligent, conduct flanking movements, and don't just bull rush a position.  Enemy fire is accurate but not wild.  The characters come in an assortment of looks and carry a variety of weapons.  From the solider in full military gear to the skinny man in jeans and without a shirt, the characters fit EXACTLY into the story.

Graphics are...well...breathtaking.  The first minute of the game is spent riding in a taxi-cab to a town.  During that ride, I found myself just looking around taking in the scenery like a tourist.  As we roll through small shanty-towns, it feels like Africa...something you might see on a National Geographic or Discovery Channel show.  The landscape is amazing.  Background sounds -- birds chirping, wind blowing, monkeys and other wild animals...this game has them all.  Passing through some towns, burning piles of trash and equipment are seen.  Ubisoft did their homework.

Controls are standard though there is a bit of delay when cycling through game options.  Farcry2, instead of displaying a standard game menu, puts everything in a book.  It's a clever design but adds a slight lag to the menu.

My only gripe is with the monocular.  It can only be used when the map is open.  Opening the map fills the center of the screen.  So, open map, raise monocular.  That could become a problem if a bad guy shows up.

Game is amazing despite the DRM.  A worthy successor to Far Cry.

It was fast, it had 3-D polygonal graphics, ( a big deal in the day ) 60 FPS, and was just plain cool. VR was also the first racing game to have different view systems, there were four in all and that also was a big deal in the day. But lets get down to brass tacks shall we? "" We shall! "" Virtue Racing was ported to the good old Sega Saturn in 1995, ( after being on the Genesis and 32X ) and boy howdies is it ever fun. It wasn't my first racer on the SS, Daytona USA was my first one and VR had a lot to live up to. One of the other reviewers said, "" the cars handled badly, and the graphics were bad too! "" Well I'm here to say, Balderdash!!! Well I guess we're all entitled to our own lame opinions, so this is my lame opinion! So after reading what our one star friend had to say I pulled it out of my collection and I totally forgot how fun it was.

I must be honest, the graphics aren't up to par compared to today's games, or even the 128 bit games of 15 years ago IE: The Dreamcast, PS2, and Xbox, but when the gameplay is this good it doesn't matter. The colors are crisp, the soundtrack is great, and it's Red Book audio. That means you can listen to it on your CD player, and it's a great soundtrack too! The Saturn version has seven new courses and four new cars compared to the other ports of VR. It also has the Grand Prix mode, this means you drive a series of cars and tracks to earn points. You start the race in a go cart, A GO CART!, and it's way fun progressing through the many tracks and races, The re-play value is here in spades with all the different modes and cars to play with.

I was bringing my xbox 360 system to a friend's house to play LAN parties with 2 TVs in separate rooms. I found it quite annoying since we would have to occupy the 2 rooms, so if others were there, it was quite an obstacle. So, I bought this for portable reasons and convenience. I originally bought this for the 360 however I did a trade for a ps4, which still works just as good.

When using this device it requires a outlet for its own monitor, so you're going to need 2 outlets (the other for your console). You can buy your own duel plug to store inside the case, however it does take a bunch of room. You'd think you could fit 2 controllers inside this case since it looks as though you may, however you're going to need to save that room for the wiring of your console and the monitor itself. For the xbox 360, I'm able to fit only one controller, but the ps4 I'm able to fit 2 controllers. There's a pad on the inside to fit the system comfortably inside, and you don't need to move it once you strap it down.

One of the downsides to this is that the monitor is not true 1080. It may say 1080 once you boot the monitor up, however that's not the true 1080i/p, which renders at 1320+. For technicality it is 1080, but it's really a 720p resolution at 60hz. Another problem is the ""white screen"" that happens every now and then. I actually don't know the real reason why the monitor does this at start, however to fix this problem all you need to do is turn on the monitor first until the blue screen appears before you turn on your console.

One of the best things about the Vanguard is the input lag. There's no monitor with no input lag. If you want no input lag, the last would probably be the classic white xbox 360 with AVI jacks through an old television. The vanguard has been tested to be around 15ms or 3 frames at 60fps.

The levels are back to being fully explorable, you can flip back and forth between numerous characters on the bottom screen again and yes, THEY HAVE GIVEN YOU THE JUMP ABILITY BACK (I know this is a big deal for a lot of people)! Plays pretty much the same as the previous lego batman games. They have implemented the gold brick challenges and are now viewable before starting a mission eliminating the guess work. They're pretty simple like finding hidden items, collecting a certain amount of studs. At the start of the game you will play mostly as Batman and Robin but you will be playing as other superheroes at the game progresses.

Other features include full voice acting and real cutscenes that don't feel like they've been rushed. If you've played the Lego Batman 2 then you know Batman and Robin (and other characters) have multiple abilities that need to be swapped through and they can quickly be equipped and unequipped without changing the character itself. So for example, Robin's hazard suit can be taken on and off instead of having two separate Robin characters. The game at times does make use of the stylus/touchscreen as well for puzzles.

Long story short if you (or your kid) loved Lego Batman 1 and 2 on the handheld then this one is an instant buy.

EDIT: One more thing to point out. If you lose all of your hearts you DO NOT have to start the level over.

The character doesn't feel floaty or bloated in any way.  The mechanics of the game are fantastic as well, complete puzzles to unlock bonus items, refill your life bar, and eliminate enemies.  Switch back to the platforming and continue on your way.  It keeps the game fresh all the way through.

On top of that there are a ton of ""power-ups"" to unlock as you progress as well.

Hours of fantastic gameplay wrapped up in a lovely little package.  Definitely check it out if you like the two genres mentioned!

Oh, lastly, I wouldn't call this a ""kids"" game in any way.  It offers some real challenge to even experienced gamers such as myself, but persistence will eventually get you through the game as well if you're skills aren't quite up to snuff.","Fantastic game, platform puzzler with great controls!",1237766400,15,,

The gameplay: Incredible!  This game should easily win game of the year!  Why?  It's so realistic, so breathtaking, so nerve wracking at times that you really feel that you are Sam Fisher.  Here are the basic moves: You can crouch, roll (to move quickly through one area without being seen), jump, double jump (jump off a wall to cling on to a pipe at the top), split jump (where your up against the wall doing the splits.  You cant then jump down in surprise and knock out your enemy, or shoot him), cling to pipes (and move around, even hang from it while shooting down a guard).  Those are just a few!  You can knock people out, put a gun to their head and interrogate them.  Use people as human shields, hide against walls, knockout anybody, slide down a wire, etc...  So many moves, all so very cool, you'll really feel like a secret agent.  Now with these moves, you must make it through dozens of levels to prevent a war from happening.  If caught, the U.S. will have nothing to do with u.  You're on your own.
Gadgets: Thankfully, with these awsome moves, you have perhaps the coolest gadgets ever thought up.  You have gadgets to unlock doors, look under the door, climb walls, shock people to death, etc...  So many cool gadgets!  You'll need every one of them to get through this war.  But that's not all!  You later on get cameras that you can shoot into a room to see everything before you enter, giving you time to plan, think, etc...  These cameras though (so cool) can also, when pressing the red B button, make a loud whistling sound that will attract guards.  When they are close, push the yellow Y button, and a sleeping gas will enter the air, knocking the guards unconscience, and leaving your path clear.  These cameras also have night vision, heat vision, and of course, regular vision.  So many uses, these cameras may save your life more than once.  Use them wisely.
The game: In the game, you must get through different levels, finding out secrets in various ways, and doing whatever is asked of u.  U can read e-mails from hacked computers, listen in silently on conversations, hide dead or living bodies (you can either knock them out or put a bullet to their head).  Sam is also equipped with heat and night vision goggles.  So when you have been spotted, and several guards are coming your way, you can shoot out nearby lights, split jump and watch blind guards come in.  Put your night vision goggles on, jump down, put a gun to one's head, and use him as a human shield.  Shoot the others, knockout your hostage, hide the bodies, and move on.  So many options of doing almost anything during gameplay, you'll be spoiled of how to beat each mission...or come back later and beat it on a harder setting.  You can also pick up and throw bottles, coke cans, anything.  The whole process of the game is very cool.
The graphics: In case you haven't heard, this game has some of the best graphics ever seen in a game.  One of my friend's walked in, sat down, not seeing the controller in my hand.  He thought I was watching a movie for a few seconds!  That's how good this game looks.  The lighting is fantastic.  Knock out all the lights, pitch black.  Leave a tiny bulb on, a lite glow fills the room.  Very cool!  Sam even changes.  He rolls up his sleeves, breathes in and out, steadies his gun when running so as to not make a clit, clat noise.  Etc...  So much detail put into everything.  Even things like when Sam's hands are busy (like hanging from a pole), he cocks his head up, then down, to get his night or heat vision goggles on.  Sooooooooooo realistic!
Depth: Incredible!  On the normal setting, you'll be lucky to beat this game in less than 30 hours.  And the ability to go back and beat the game on hard later adds even more replay value!  This game has it all!
Overall, this game rocked in every aspect.  Even sound (perhaps the best ever in a game) is ignored because of how good everything else is.  Voice acting is so realistic, as Sam always sounds confident, and yet sometimes doubtful, and even a bit nervous.  You can hear how fast you're running, the footsteps of approaching enemies, the true reloading of your gun (which ranges from silencers and snipers, to machine guns at times), and the shells falling to the floor.
This game really showed off the power of the XBOX, and the kind of games it can support, and people may come to expect.  This is a classic, a must have, and any gamer should feel left out never playing Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell!

Some of the professional reviews for this game are pretty negative and I almost didn't buy it because of them. That would have been a big mistake on my part because the game is a blast to play. Yeah, you pretty much are just running around with a sword killing barbarians but is that really so different then running around with a gun in Call of Duty? I don't think so. In fact, as I play through this game it reminds me very much a Call of Duty type of game. It is heavily scripted, combat oriented game. There are even scenes where you man stationary weapons against vast hordes of enemies just like in Call of Duty.

What really shines in this game are the execution finishing moves you use in combat. There are a ton of them so you are always seeing something different. I do wish they could have come up with a better way to indicate what buttons to press during an execution besides the colored glow. Maybe make it so when your enemy is staggered that you punch in a combo like in Mortal Kombat to perform an execution. Not sure if that would work though as the battles are pretty hectic.

So far this game is really fun and addictive.  I was a little annoyed with the fact that you can't just punch people in the face and things like that.  It doesn't really make sense that you can't get in fights with people on the street.  I quickly got past that because of the various fun things to do while walking around.  I have only done a couple pieces of the campaign so far because I keep getting distracted by everything.

Many people have complained about the driving.  I think that the driving is a little hard, but definitely doesn't keep me from enjoying the game.  I have actually gotten used to it and if you figure it out, it really isn't that difficult to control.  Most of the fun things to do are done on foot anyway.

Hacking is fun and I keep stumbling upon random crimes and crazy stuff by listening in and reading people's text messages.  There are a lot of situations where you are able to create your own strategy, and this is a lot of fun.

It's hard to go into all the random things you can do, but this game is definitely worth 60 bucks.  If you have any specific questions about the game, feel free to ask.

Overall:  In the future I would like to see even more interaction with the city.  I would like to be able to go into even more buildings, be able to sit down, talk to people, and just interact with more objects everywhere.  This is a great start though, and I feel like it is well worth the price tag and I will be getting a lot of play time out of it.

I initially was impressed by the vastly upgraded graphics for this next gen system. The game is smooth and looks & feels great.

Upon playing it is clear they are going for a solid story adventure game. There is a lot of dialog and plenty of new characters to meet. It starts off with a bit of action, then backstory gameplay. Regardless of what I was doing, it was fun and I took my time to check out everything. Lots to look at.

One of the biggest pros for me is the style of the controller. Based heavily off of the Xbox 360 controllers, it's very easy to map and get used to, especially if you own or have owned a 360 as I have. The feel is almost exact to the 360 controllers as well, so there is nothing to really get used to aside from the fan vents. Now, the controller has 2 fan options, one being a kind of subtle fan that hardly cools the hands or prevents sweating. In that sense, it's kind of useless, but much quieter so it may be optimal for those needing to use it in a quiet environment or for those who casually game and/or have seldom sweating in the palms. The second fan option, however, is much faster and, in turn, louder. It does a magnificent job keeping my hands cool even during intense gaming sessions which prevents the controller from slipping and provides for precision gaming. If your hands are prone to sweating during those intense gaming sessions, and are familiar with the Xbox 360 controller, then I would heavily recommend this controller. For the price, this unit is definitely worth it. If you are a casual gamer, however, or tend to play games that don't use a controller (FPS, RTS) then I'd suggest something cheaper for the sake of price vs. usage.",One of the Best Gaming Controllers I've Used,1271635200,,,

I know there are some people out their that are very disappointed in how this turned out, but I have a theory on that, they played THPS2 so much that when THPS3 came out it played the same for them.
Well I have THPS and THPS2, and after a while I moved on to other games, sure I picked them up every now and then, but after completing them 90+ percent...well it got a little old.
Not in this game. The graphics are by far some of the best that the PS2 has to offer. The create a skater is a lot of fun, and takes up very little of memory space to save them.
The game play is very tight. Sometimes to tight! Sure the career mode is the same, you know collect S-K-A-T-E get a certain score, but they added fun things to do like ""stop the pick pocketers"", ""bury the dude throwing snowballs"", ""unstick Chuck from the flagpole"", ""squash the pumkins"", get the ""satelitte working"" to name a few. This is just the top of the barrell folks. The two player mode is great. Plus it has the option of online play.

The first thing you notice is how gorgeous this game is.  The graphics are amazing and really give a feel for being there.  There is no feel of shift form in-game video and cut scenes like some other titles.  From open fields and Russian mountains to tight alleys in Baghdad, everything has a real feel to it.  Lighting, character models, animations, terrain, nothing is left behind as far as quality goes.  While the graphics are amazing, one map stands above the rest.  The Sniper map near the middle of the single player campaign is breathtaking.  It is shocking how good that level looks, there are times I stop just so I can look around.  The lighting in particular stands out on that level.

The voice work is also well done.  There is none of the awkward, third rate soap acting that we have come to expect from most titles.  For once, the voice acting actually adds to the title, instead of detracting from it.

Story for first person shooters aren't always the best, and while the one in this COD4 is good for a FPS story-line, it isn't particularly great.  It is about what could be expected, and many stereotypes are played upon.  There is a high point.  The ability to play through the death of a character, is amazing.  There isn't any action in the scene, and the characters already a gonner.  But to be able to crawl out of the downed chopper and into the nuclear blast ravaged country-side before dying is priceless and a great innovation.  The one real problem the game has is in the story telling, specifically the ending.  It feels very abrupt, and makes me wish there was more of a transition.  The end practically sneaks up on you.

The sequel brought fans a heavy dose of nostalgia on the Wii. This edition brings out the best of both worlds, with new sidequests to flesh out fan-favourites like Genis, Presea and Zelos. If that wasn't enough, the Japanese voices are available for the first time ever, so otakus who refuse to watch anime in English will finally have their wishes granted.

The story (for the original game) appears simple and cookie-cutter fantasy fare - save the world and defeat the villain. Not long into the story, though, the player discovers much more hiding behind the scenes than they expected. Profoundly mature themes of racism, slavery, oppression and loyalty arise, and end up making one of the top-tier Tales games one of the top-tier RPGs ever created.

The combat is as intuitive, immersive and entertaining as ever, with HD graphics and faster load times for the Playstation 3. Add a whole bunch of new weapons into the mix and Symphonia's gut-wrenching story with tension and twists every twenty minutes, and you've got a recipe for an instant classic.

If you missed out on playing Tales of Symphonia the first time, don't make the same mistake twice. There is a copious amount of new material more than sufficient to make it enjoyable for fans to revisit this game for the second or third time.

It's a neat concept.  The game has 4 hours worth of songs, all at varying speeds, and you earn points by walking at the same speed as the song.  You spend those points unlocking scenery, different routes, and songs.  There's a good deal of variety in the soundtrack once you unlock them all. I think it only starts you out with about 10 songs, so you'll want to make hunting down the rest of them.  Most of them are ok.  Lotta upbeat, peppy stuff, appropriate for light exercise.  The only one I found unlistenable was Soulja Boy's ""Kiss Me Through The Phone.""  I wish there was an option to skip songs, but you can remove individual tracks from your playlist.

The game keeps track of how many miles you walked and how many calories you burned in each session, which is helpful.  In addition to the various unlockables throughout the island, there are 7 pieces of rainbow to hunt for.  The rainbow pieces don't cost anything to unlock and are a nice touch to give a purpose to your exercise.  I usually play it with a dance mat, but it can be played with the fitness board (still okay but not as fun) or the Wii remote (never tried it).

I'm glad I bought the game and would do so again. Still, I must admit I was a tad disappointed.
Here's my take:
Right-on:
Compelling music
Diversity of maps
Slew of new weapons
More realistic physics in some areas, such assault weapons (you REALLY need to use short controlled bursts)
Some elements of the graphics are impressive
Fact-filled historical info
The navigation and intro screen capture the era and set the mood for the game.
Bummers:
Resource intense game that will tax even high-end systems
Color palette is somewhat drab and flat.
While the graphics are more complex, I found the overall effect less realistic that the original game.
The pyrotechnics for the firing and hits of artillery and tank main guns sucks when compared with the original.
I'm hopeful things will improve in a future expansion.

When I finish the game, I'll edit this review.

The question on many people's minds before buying this game will probably be: is it glitchy like the first? A little bit, but not nearly as bad. When The Walking Dead Season 1 first came out on disk, there were a lot of angry people (myself included) because the glitches made it unplayable on some consoles. It was eventually fixed with patches, but it still caused a lot of frustration at the time. I remember getting about halfway through the second episode, saving my game, and then when I came back to play some more the WHOLE game started over! Another time I completed an episode only to have the game freeze on the stats screen so I couldn't continue. So far, I'm about halfway through the third episode on The Walking Dead Season 2 and I've experienced a bit of lag, but nothing so far on the level of the first game's game-breaking glitches. The lag usually comes on the ""previously on The Walking Dead"" and sometimes on the menu. During the game itself I haven't really had an issue except some really minor lag sometimes when there's a lot happening on screen, but nothing as bad as the first game where it got you killed. That said, I believe this minor issue will be fixed with a patch.

After it was all patched up, the first Walking Dead game became mine and many people's Game of the Year for that year. The sequel looks to be the same. Already the first episode was much better than Episode 1 of the first game. I won't spoil anything, but you really feel for Clementine's (the little girl you play) situation and there were a few parts that actually made me scream out loud. The suspense is really good. If you never played the first Walking Dead, this isn't an action/shooter. It's more of a point-and-click Adventure game with a strong emphasis on story and characters. Your actions and dialogue choices change the story and the way people react to you, and sometimes you have to choose who lives and who dies. There is zombie killing, but it's more ""quick click on the gun to pick it up, now click on the bullets and load the gun, oh no I dropped the bullets! The zombie is getting closer! Hurry!"" than button mashing. You don't have to have played the first game to follow the story, but it helps as this is a continuation (and the choices you made in the first game can transfer over to the second).

The second and third episodes so far have a strong emphasis on humans being the bigger bad guy than zombies. I love The Walking Dead show, but these games to me do a better job of adapting the comics, from the art style to the strong characters and writing.

Recommended.

UPDATE (10/22/14): I'm on the last episode now. Still no problems with glitches, except for really bad lag during the ""previously on The Walking Dead"". This is a short game but it is NOT five hours as another reviewer on here commented. I spent about three hours just on the first episode. The game is about the same length as the first, about twelve hours long with replayability.

UPDATE (10/27/14): I finished the game. I did experience ONE glitch on the last episode, but it happened ten seconds after the game autosaved so I just reloaded and it wasn't a big deal. After finishing the game I think the story is even better than the first game! And, yes, they even topped the first game's ending.

Now, what this game brings to the table is the ability to have a Downtown, which is a new area that has a lot more fun locations to explore.

THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME:
1. You are able to go to nightclubs, bowling alleys, restaurants, and bars.
2. There is a new Pleasure Aspiration, which basically has you fulfill fun goals (like going bowling, jump on the couch, watch TV, etc.).
3. You can go on dates.  You basically take a sim out somewhere (or invite them to your home) and you try to improve your relationship with them and have a good date.
4. There are vampires.  I thought that the vampires are fun and unique to the game.
5. There is new matchmaker.  Basically, you pay her money, and the more you pay her, the better a date she gets you.
6. You choose ""turn-ons and turn-offs.""  These are basically what you find attractive and disgusting in a person.  For instance you might be attracted to someone who's fit and has blond hair but not be attracted to someone who stinks.
7. You get new clothes and hairstyles, which aren't numerous, but they are really fun.
8. You can go on group outings with multiple people.

THE BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME:
1. It's really hard to become a vampire if you want to become one.

There really aren't that many bad things about the game!  I did find it a little expensive, but it is still a great addition to the series.  Definitely get it for $20 or less, but I recommend that you don't pay $30.","This makes ""The Sims 2"" a lot more fun!",1262131200,,,

5.0,True,"01 5, 2014",A178FYDM3K4TE8,B000YDIYFG,J. Bruha,"Fun puzzle game.  To oversimplify what this game is, it is a puzzle game, where you either grab blocks, trying to take them out of a tower without toppling it, or else throw things at the blocks, usually to knock the tower down with the least amount of throws, and sometimes to use the ball to hurl the blocks into bulls-eyes for bonus points.
Like most games that I really like, the premise is so simple, it takes just a few minutes to figure out how to play, yet the puzzles get increasingly complex, to where it is a genuine challenge to solve.
My biggest gripe is that in multiplayer mode, about all you can do is 'random' puzzles, where the computer chooses what you play.  Only single player mode lets you pick and choose what you want to do.
Also, in single player mode, you start off with easy puzzles, and unlock more difficult ones, as you solve the previous, easier one.
From 1 to 4 players, it is a VERY good 'party game' in that in multiplayer mode it is very quick/easy to learn how to work the controls, and each game only takes a few minutes.  Also, the game requires a steady hand, so you can make the game more challenging for someone by trying to make them laugh so their hands are shaky.

I'm a 2D fighting veteran and I know which 2D fighter is worth playing all over again and which is worth ditching. However, the PlayStation version of Marvel VS Capcom is just one of those games that needs to be ditched, except for the Dreamcast conversion. Unlike its unworthy PlayStation apprentice, the Dreamcast version of Marvel VS Capcom is 100% arcade perfect in every way ! Allow me to give the lowdown on this game ! The graphics are far by, the best I've seen. Although they seem a bit dated to some people who never played or doubt the VS series, the animation is seamless, with no frames chopped off. The characters look brighter and they move much faster and smoother than that of the arcade version. Including the backgrounds which looks very colorful, but some of them looks like they're featured in an enhanced 16-bit game. But despite of that, the Dreamcast's power is capable of making 2D fighters look better than any other 2D fighters on different home consoles. The sound still remains the same as the arcade and PSX original. The music sounds fairly catchy, but could've been better if Q-Sound hadn't made the music too loud and too flashy to bother even the most patient person in the house. As for the sound effects, almost as similar to that of the earlier VS series, but much improved. You'll still hear a whole lot of the same punching noises and the same hits taken from a super beam or a flame toasted fist. And for the voice acting, the same again, but the only voice that changed, was Ryu's. His character sprite may be based on the original Street Fighter Alpha character, but Capcom designed him to give him his old red headband he had while he was growing older, and make his voice sound a little deeper. As for the gameplay, very well done. The PSX controls didn't do much of the justice but the design of the Dreamcast control fits the gameplay very well. With the DC controller, Marvel VS Capcom plays like a charm ! Yes my friends...it's that good ! And plus, you get the tag feature, where you can switch your characters anytime you want, especially when your first character is losing energy. And as for the game modes, you get five of them, which should be enough to please you. You still get the Arcade mode, along with the 2 player VS mode, Survival mode, Cross Fever mode, and Training mode. As for the selection of characters, it's okay...I guess. You get characters from the Marvel universe from the US and the Capcom universe from Japan. On the Capcom side we've got Ryu, Chun-Li, Zangief, Mega Man, Strider Hiryu, Jin, Morrigan, Captain Commando, and Roll (as a secret character). On the Marvel Comics side we've got Wolverine, Spider-Man, Venom, Gambit, Hulk, and War Machine. The Marvel side does have its share of secret characters, but all of them are alternatives of the same character. But still, while the DC conversion has some flaws, it's still arcade perfect and furthermore, it has no loading times. Marvel VS Capcom for the Dreamcast is one game that shouldn't be left behind. I know what you're saying. I didn't really explain that much detail on the PlayStation version. But the reason why, is because its hard to explain complete details about a horrible port of a true Capcom classic. The DC version was simple to explain, because it defined arcade perfect with a vengeance ! Like I said, if you want the true Marvel VS Capcom experience, play the arcade version or just play this one ! You'll be proud you did !",The arcade perfect version of Marvel VS Capcom !,1025222400,4,,

Sonic The Fighters 10/10

I played this about a year ago in a arcade but it was called Sonic Cmapinship there. The game was about whe Dr. Robonik bulids the death egg 2 and it must be dystroyed. Tails bulids a ship but the bad news is that it can only hold on person. The gang holds a fighting tourtment to see who can win it?

The Good:

This game has excellent graphics and each person comes along with there owen spcial move to use. The game really takes fighting to the next level and is also crated by the pepole who made Virtula Fighter! The game also features 2 exclussive Sonic charecter Beat the? and Bark The Palor Bear.

The Bad:

Sometimes the charecters use a attack over and over agian making it anyoing and the fighters can get hard sometimes.

Sonic R 7/10

Dr Robonik is holding the grand Prix and everyone is invited Sonic and his friends tag along for the race too!

The Good:

This is no car racing game your actully runing at high spped and you can jump over other racers and unlock other racers including super sonic!

The Bad:

Each level they play music that sounds terbile and you can't use any special weapons. Also when the charecters run it looks very un realstic. I owen the orginal Sega Satrun version and they changed some of the title screen a little bit.

Sonic CD 9/10

Dr. Robonik has bulit the deathegg and is about too blow up the planet mobuis. However Sonic is here to stop him but he has kidnapped Amy Rose and has a surprise just wating for Sonic?

The Good:

The Game has to music videos and is really cool. They also have some 3d parts in the game and you can go to the future and past.

The Bad:

Some of the levels are anoying at times and you can't play as anyone else.

I honestly have never been that much of a fan of some Logitech products, and I otherwise probably would not have paid too much attention to these expensive headphones.

But when you hold them in your hands you'll be very impressed by their quality I think. They are very well constructed and their price is well justified by that. The cloth braid covered cord is really nice (though it can be a bit stiff).

Sounds quality is great, mic quality is excellent (they work very well with Vista's built-in voice recognition software). They have excellent passive noise reduction, so much so that you'll want to mix some of the mic input into the speaker output so you can hear yourself talk while using them.

They're comfortable for a long gaming session, though they are relatively heavy as headsets go, and they grip your head pretty tightly which might be an issue for some people (though they don't press on your ears as some do).

If you want a really light headset then look somewhere else, but if you want an extra high quality full size headset then I can strongly recommend these!

The drivers worked with no problems on Vista 64. The software provides the usual sorts of controls, plus some voice morphing software (which is cute for about five minutes until the people on Ventrilo threaten to kick you from the raid if you don't turn it off). The simulated surround sound experience is ok, about the same as my old $500 Sony wireless surround sound headphones. But without another 5.1 holes drilled in your head that 7.1 channel sound experience will always be lacking a bit no matter what. And there's a switch to turn off the surround effect for when you're not watching a movie.

There are some other nice touches too. There's a red led in the end of the mic boom to remind you when you've muted it, and the mic mutes automatically if you swing the boom up an out of the way. There are three programmable switches, a large rolling volume control, and a mute button on the left ear cup, The buttons can be programmed through the included software to do things like enable/disable the voice morphing, or control applications like iTunes or Ventrilo.

So: Great build quality, a cut above in design and construction, good passive noise cancellation, drivers that just worked, and overall an experience worth at least what they're charging for them. The size and weight might not be for everyone, but for someone who likes a full size headset, these are the best I've seen yet.

So I try to stick now more with affordable, lower priced headsets. I only use over the ear headphones and never in the ear sets. I have tried previous Sades Headsets and have always been happy with their combination of quality and price and the SA913  model was no different.

These are awesome (and I do mean awesome) PC/LAP top headphones that have incredible sound.  How can these cost just $30??? The headset is lightweight and comfortable and I really had little problem with them getting too hot even when worn for a while.  These are true plug and play via USB connect.  No drivers need to be installed.  the sound is outstanding.  They are designed to deliver a surround sound like experience and they really do.  These things reverberate and are awesome for gaming or for watching movies.  They deliver a rich sound with unbelievable bass and crystal clear highs.

These also feature outstanding nose reduction capability.  I sometimes use them in a loud environment and it pretty much blocks out all but the loudest and most direct noises.  It's possible to just lose yourself in the experience when using these.  The microphone is very clear and has a good range that can still pick up voices from several feet away when placed on the ground so make sure you mute them if you don't want something picked up.

Obviously they are adjustable and the mic rotates for optimal placement. The earphones also have LED lights for some cool effects but honestly that is not a big selling point with me.

I bought this game used about 2 weeks after it came out. I got to the part where you are attacked by the indestructible creature in the room where you basically have to just survive for about a minute without getting killed by enemies spawning from every corner of the room. I was so terrified that I thought my heart was going to explode out of my chest. I returned the game to Gamestop and got Far Cry 2 instead which I proceeded to spend the next 40 hours or so playing and loving.

Everytime I went to Gamestop, I would look at Dead Space and be tempted to pick it up again. Finally, about 9 months later, the game was selling for $20 and I picked it up again. I was hooked. I played the game all the way through and when I beat the last boss, I started the game again and there is a new Game + feature where you get to keep all your weapons and attributes from the last game. This is an awesome game that did not get the sales it deserves. It will be getting a sequel though which is awesome.

Graphics: The graphics on this game are simply very impressive. One of the reasons why I was not interested in this game when the previews first started appearing was the fact that it appeared to just be a corridor shooter. Didn't look very interesting really. Good reviews started coming out and this led to my initial purchase of the game. It really looks amazing. You really feel like you are on a ship all alone fighting legion of unstoppable demons. Character models are amazing. Isaac's movements, reload animations and finishing moves are totally kick ass.

Gameplay: This is the perfect horror shooter game. Better than RE5 as you get to shoot and run--one of the dumbest holdouts for RE5 BTW. That being said, this game is pretty much a copy of the all of the elements of RE4. Yes I did not make a mistake. This game is closer to RE4 that RE5 as this game has no coop element, and RE5 threw out the merchant element. In Dead Space, You have the merchant(the store),  you get items from crates, you have an inventory function where you have to conserve space for weapons, ammo and health, there are a variety of cool guns--all of which can be upgrades with increased capacity, firepower, etc.

Overall: Get this game. I recommend playing this game on Easy the first time through as it does get pretty hairy having creatures attack from all sides and no way to pause to check inventory. BTW, that brings up pretty much the only negative. The New Game + feature only allows you to play the same difficult level. Why not let you try playing on hard with the best armor and guns??",This game is simply one of the best EVER,1266624000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

If it wasn't for sneak peaks, this game would have petrified players, especially those wholike me, saw it grow from the 90's. The PC version comes with 3CDs, a manual and even a disclaimer from id Software recommending and cautioning (lol) about playing this game in the dark with speakers on loud!

Doom 3 retains its storyline of the UAC on Mars. This time though, the plot has more depth (I won't ruin it for you). The graphics of course have been much acclaimed. They truly are mind-blowing; even the machine for this game is. Monsters respawn if you backtrack but never in the same location twice! This helps in keeping you on your toes. Levels are also well balanced (although there are a few ambush-spots). Health packs are scattered throughoutthe level but now there are health can also be ""recharged"" around 10 times. These are found in special rooms on the walls. Also, Doom 3 now doesn't have the mindless killing like its predecessors. Now, the player has missions, some even as basic as finding scientists and PDAs! The monsters are diverse (each monster has a cutscene introducing them....and sometimes just watch out for hints...with your speakers on high), and so are the weapons (including the ""living and breathing"" one). Also, the concept of bosses is now more emphasized. So much for the pros.

Now the cons. Storyline has depth, but there are 27 (around) levels! I doubt even the first Doom games had these many. The only variation of these levels arethat they either take place inside the UAC building or outside in the red heat of the planet (and that's not even for long anyway). Only the last few levels have some more variety. The player even makes a trip to Hell, which amazed me, but that was before I was made to go there again. Much as I love the monsters, I'll admit they aren't all...well-balanced. The Imps probably appear well over a hundred times (not exaggerating) throughout the entire game! The Pinkys on the other hand only appear 10 to 15 times. The Hell Knights make appearances even fewer than the Pinkeys. But despite this imbalance, the process of them appearing and them disappearing happens too fast. I rarely get a chance to absorb the ""evolution"" id Software has effected upon these monsters. Most of these appear in dark places, and they are very agile (except for the zombies but they get boring in while) and move very fast. They also evaporate after being killed (or the PC'd collapse integrating all the corpses into its memory). The darkness, though very important in setting up the eerie atmosphere inthe game, gets a little redundant as the player has to constantly switch from flashlight to weapon. But I think there is a patch that tapes the flashlight on the pistol =).

Borderlands: The Handsome Collection isn't a reinvention of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands the Pre-Sequel. The graphics aren't significantly better, but they don't need to be. The highly stylized cel shaded graphics looked great on the PS3, and still look great. I haven't noticed any difference in the audio quality at all, but the games never sounded bad. Gameplay hasn't changed, the content is the same. That's the way PS4 remakes of games generally are. Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition, The Last of Us Remastered, Saints Row Re-Elected, they take a great game with lots of content, include the DLC with the main game and port it over to the PS4. Some have graphics updates or some improved audio quality, but gameplay and content remains the same.

While what you're getting is the same as the previous generation of consoles, what you're getting is a lot of awesome content with a ton of replay value. The same humorous dialogue is there. The combat is as fun as it's ever been. The DLC is mostly very good. There are, from my perspective, three things that the Handsome Collection does that are an improvement over the previous iterations. 1) All the DLC is included. I was happy to pay for the season pass for Borderlands 2 because of the sheer amount of content included but held off on the Presequel season pass since I knew this was coming. There's a ton of extra content included on top of already enormous games. 2) I know quite a few people who bought PS4's that never owned PS3's, meaning I'll be able to play with them. 3) Multiplayer communities fade after a while and I was starting to have trouble finding good groups for Borderlands 2. This will add a more robust multiplayer community for a while. Your saved games also transfer over, making it so you don't lose all those hours of progress, which is really a selling point for someone who has already played the games since it would be hard to stomach starting all over again.

If you're already familiar with the Borderlands games you should skip this paragraph, but if not, here's a brief synopsis of what the games are like. The best example I could give would be the if the Diablo series was a first person shooter and wasn't procedurally generated. You play as a vault hunter, a treasure hunter of sorts, on the world of Pandora. Several mega-corporations are present on the planet, most notably the Hyperion corporation run by Handsome Jack. In each game there are several classes to choose from each with different special abilities and focusing on different styles of combat. You gain experience from combat and missions that you use to level up your character starting at level 5. The original level cap is set at 50 but with DLC, which is included, it is increased beyond that. As you play you collect gear that is dropped or rewarded. The gear you collect is weapons, shields, character specific relics and grenade mods. There is a fairly standard system of common to epic gear with tougher enemies dropping better gear. Playing in coop increases enemy difficulty and also increases the gear dropped. Gear drops are a free for all with the first person to grab it winning. In coop you can trade equipment if so desired and duel other players if so desired. The world is an open sandbox style world with terminals to teleport from area to area. There is a linear progression in the unlocking of new areas, but once they are unlocked you can come and go as you please. There are two new game plus modes. The first new game plus assumes you're starting your second run through around level 33 with enemies having static levels according to what level you should be. After that is another new game plus where enemies scale to your level allowing you to always have enemies that you can gain experience from.

Borderlands: The Handsome Collection is a lot of the same. But there's a lot of the lot of the same, and it's great content. If you didn't like the games before you're not going to like them now. And if you're content playing the games on the PS3 this would probably be a waste of money. But if you're new to the games, or want to play with other people you know who have PS4's, or want to just upgrade to the PS4 version it's really hard to go wrong. There isn't anything new or innovative, but the sheer amount of value from so much really well done content packaged into a standard game price means you will get the bang for your buck.","Oh the valuation, the valuation.",1427241600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Rodriguez,"The reason why this accessory is so essential is because of the description for the logitech driving force wheel: ""900-degree wheel rotation: Go 2.5 times around lock to lock, just as you would behind the wheel of many real cars.""  The importance of being able to shift gears while keeping both hands on the wheel that is rotated well passed 180 degrees is crucial.  In tight curves losing grip on the wheel can be the reason for crashing and losing control which is exactly what was happening to me before getting this accessory.  Either took one hand off to use the shift stick, or loosen my grip to pin point the ""lost"" small button behind the wheel to shift.  This was frustrating and completely game breaker.  I have used it while playing GT6 and the improvement is significant.  Sometimes i press against the edges of this paddles and still hit the button to shift gears, so the range is from edge to edge not just the center.

PROS:
+easy to install
+does not interfere with anything on the wheel, all buttons are accessible
+light yet sturdy
+improves the driving experience significantly

CONS:
-the plastic at the hinges where the paddles are hooked seem a little weak, only time will tell if they survive long hours of use.

Overall this is a specialty product, so the price ($55) is all right for me.  Is the only option available that is not taped to the wheel and it does work as advertised.

I've had a lot of fun with this and that's without doing very many of the over-arching plot missions. I love the hit-man assignments (though I'll admit I've had to look up online how the heck to get some of them to spawn the target) and also the chop-shop car stealing runs, though I suck at identifying some of the makes that are similar to each other so that makes it more of a challenge. Stealing one of everything on the map is helping with that; got most of the vehicle types in the game stashed in the garage of endless space now (edit: rats, finally ran out of room at around 60).

Character customization is great and so is are the options when you go to buy clothes for them. You're not just buying clothes in a pre-set color or pattern, but you can usually customize the heck out of them to the point where the same clothing item can look like anything from a black open long-sleeved sweater with white buttons (formal chic, anyone?) to a gangsta basketball jacket-shirt. And yes... with the initial character customization settings you can very definitely make a she-male (yay for the M rating lol) and then crossdress the heck out of things if that's your thing. It's mine, so rock on.

I would have liked more options in the voice choices, which for a guy are ghetto/gangsta dude, pseudo-British goon, and mister bad Spanish accent. So my obviously Asian guy sounds like Antonio Banderas... the least not-like-my-character choice there was. I'm actually finding it pretty humorous, but yeah, could have used a few more options there... though you can also choose from the three girl voices too. XD

So yeah, everybody plays a game differently, and a sandbox game is the most true to that concept. That's how I've played it so far, and I look forward to doing more of the actual plot missions so that I can finally take over more neighborhoods.

He has already mastered many of the nuances of motivating the prisoners to work for privileges and he has reduced the number of shiv incidents by over 90% in just one month of playing the game. Not only do the prisoners love him, but the guards love his policies too. It is hard to believe that a game like this could inspire a young man to want to grow up to rehabilitate incarcerated felons, but it really is making an impact on his life.

Often, after playing 4 or 5 hours of Prison Architect after school, he will sit down at the table with us for dinner (we have family dinner because unlike some parents who let their kids do anything, we have rules!) and ask poignant questions like, ""Why are so many young men incarcerated in our country dad?"" Or, ""Do you think the war on drugs is working?""  Often we will end up with a very passionate discussion and his grandfather (who is a Fox News worshipper) will stomp out of the house grumbling about our parenting policies.  It's great!

Most importantly, it is teaching him things like supply and demand, motivating people, and even understanding all of the little things that go on behind the scenes in running a large institution like a prison. We have to keep an eye on him to make sure that some of the more sordid aspects of the game are not activated, since he is just nine years old. We don't want him learning about exchanging favors among the inmates or guards accepting bribes so that the prisoners can run a drug business from inside the prison. At least not yet!

Anyway, we are really excited for the opportunity this game has given him to explore careers outside the mainstream that he would probably never have considered before. Prison management is the wave of the future, especially as more and more prisons start to be privatized and prison wardens will command six figure salaries, and healthy bonuses and ""benefits"" if they play their cards correctly.

I was very excited about the new Remote Play function that will allow me to access all of my music, movies, and photos saved on my PS3 via a wireless connection from anywhere in the world.

After I told my friend that I was getting a PSP, he told me that he was able to use homebrew software to run NES, Genesis, and SNES emulators! I did my homework and now I'm playing the classic SNES version of Chrono Trigger on my PSP! I can play Zelda, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mario, Contra, Metroid, you name it. I'll bet your Nintendo DS can't do that...

The Sony PSP boasts, hands down, the nicest screen of ANY hand held device on the market. iPod video? Please... Microsoft Zune? Yeah right. Take a good look at the screen. It's SWEET! Movies on this screen look AWESOME. Yeah, obviously UMD movies are around the same price as DVD's and its a propriety format, but they pump out pretty good quality. I have 3 UMD's of classic movies I would watch on the road. Am I going to buy a lot more? No. But they're nice to have around. Besides, you can download movies onto your Memory Stick Duo...

I bought a Sandisk 4 GB Memory Stick Pro Duo for my PSP. That way I could fit music, movies, pictures, games, whatever...Did I mention that you can now play original Playstation games on this machine now too? Right now you need a PS3 to play them, but if you do your homework and get OS 3.03 OE-B installed...then you too can play copies of your PS One library. Final Fantasy VII or Metal Gear Solid on the go anyone?

The games for the PSP are getting MUCH better now too. Metal Gear Portable OPS, Tekken Dark Resurrection, and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror really push the system graphically. Most importantly, these games have been designed specifically within the limitations of ""portable games"". These are not LAZY PS2 ports...In fact, many of the games are no longer ports. A year after launch the games are getting significantly better in my opinion.

Yes this system is expensive. But not as expensive as you think. Here's the breakdown of what I got and how much I paid.

1) Sony PSP- $150 sale

2) 4 GB Memory Stick Duo- $90 sale

3) Tekken DR and Syphon Filter- $32 off of eBay

4) 200 SNES, NES, and Sega Genesis classics- FREE!

5) My old PS One games- FREE!

6) Nyko Theater Experience Case- $40

I paid 325 for a PSP with 4 GB, 2 great PSP games, a HUGE library of classics to play from, and a hard case with built-in speakers, stand, and 7 hour lithium-ion battery that can charge the PSP.

You can do all of this, go online, play wireless with others for free, listen to music, watch videos on the nicest portable screen around, and access data on your PS3 from anywhere (by the end of the year Sony claims). I think it's wicked cool and I think you should agree with me. In the last week I have convinced two of my managers at work to get a PSP. They, like me, are loving every second with it. In fact, I use it more than my PS3 and my Xbox 360 right now.

It is also the finest specimen of graphic achievement on the PlayStation 2.  The entire system works.  The game is meant for the most capable recent home video systems.  Put the game in, turn on the high def television, turn up the surround sound, and you'll be hooked from the moment you see the green light.

The game has a complete sound system work-up, meaning Dolby Surround (II) audio.  The rear speakers activate when a car is behind you.  The ambient sound in the game is great.  You can completely control over four hours of music tracks.  You can also control the volume levels of the ambience, the engine noise, and the CD music.  The music has a complete variety including rock to rap, techno to classical.  You make the playlist.  You can make a seperate playlist for a photo show.

The visuals are awesome.  The game runs in high def widescreen at  1080-interlaced, plain anamorphic widescreen, or the NTSC 4:3.  This is a beautiful game.  The in-game menu has picture adjustment controls to get the right look for each viewer's video rig including contrast, brightness, and more, and you can multiply that by two because there are two full sets of controls, one for while driving and another one for the replay.  The landscapes of the raceway circuits in this game will have you gaping in awe.  You get the sensation of speed by the high frame rate and the landscape model artwork.

This is the best Grand Turismo ever.  This game puts the entire race spectrum, of all backgrounds, into the pot and layers music to it, and that's in the metaphoric sense of music.  You can prefer Formula, LeMans, Rally, Indy Cart, or NASCAR.  You can prefer trucks, SUVs, old V8s, stationwagons, 2-seater spyders, or cars less than 3400mm in length.

GT4 is the best Turismo game because it perfects its gaming system and neglects any slight flaw of previous Turismos.  The ONLY part I missed was Turismo 3's masterful introduction video microscopically touring the inside of an engine to Lenny Kravitz rock music, because it amazes me every time, whereas GT4's intro vid rather promotes it's new photo gimmick: I like the gimmick, but the vid's not as artistic as GT3, even if the Van Halen song's nice.  I have only one recommendation: I like having lap records and track records that state the driver, the car, and the record time, which was best done in the first Turismo.

One more thing, the graphics are done so well, I can tell that each vehicle has a different camera perspective in its distance from the ground.  For instance, when driving in an SUV, your seated position should be much higher than, let's say, a Formula 1 Ferarri; and in this game, each car's ""ride height"" is different.  I read a negative comment the person can't judge distance very well in this game.  (He owns an X-Box.)  I sympathize because I have the same trouble; BUT, from a real F1 Ferarri, the driver sits so close to the ground and drives so fast, it's impossible not to have to use landmarks!  NO ONE CAN SEE A TURN WHOSE EYE-LEVEL IS ABOUT 2 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  This is one of the smarter features GT4 provides.

In my view, this is one of the best aspects of the game because, at first, you're pretty much of a sitting duck in the crappy plane and weaponry you start out with; but then when you've kicked butt to the point that you have a greater wealth of choices in aircraft capability it starts getting as if you really are investing something in your choice and might actually go with a less 'capable' plane because of some particular aspect of a mission only that one is good for--outfly or out dogfight, better strategy or just sheer adrenaline, ....

Some of the planes are too manueverable, too fast, no good in tight spaces or no good at low altitude runs.  No one superplane is good for even one third of the missions.  This is basically what keeps playing the same missions over and over interesting and fresh, because as you try to accomplish the same mission in various planes you find there are drastically different advantages / disadvantages and that it influences how you go about the mission.

This game makes you use your head to succeed.

When I first played this game, I felt it was flawless and the best modern game at the time. And although I still feel this is an amazing game, I've noticed a lot more flaws through this second play through and hope to make an accurate review from these experiences.

The atmosphere of Red Dead Redemption literally makes the game, and the story is written in a way that immerses you even further into it. The stranger missions especially are so well told that some even leave you with a surreal and creepy vibe afterwords that lingers as you travel the open wastelands to your next objective. And as fun as the missions may be, and as open as your experiences can be, it's atmosphere that make them that way and it's what holds everything else together. You really feel like you're in the vast and wild West, and very rarely does this feeling escape you. The atmosphere is so great that it even manages to cover up the flaws of the game, and make you like things you would normally dislike. And when looked at critically, there are things to dislike.

One of these most disappointing features is that most missions are favor missions. You meet someone, they ask you to do something, and you do it. These are usually the most annoying and generic missions in a video game, yet they make up the majority of Red Dead Redemption. Some variety and innovation would have definitely been welcomed here. This adds heavily to another concern in that the game really isn't about John Marston - it's about the people he meets. This is especially true in Mexico, because none of the events and missions directly affect him at all and he says multiple times that their affairs and politics are none of his concern. Until the last third, the game is more about the Wild West in general and uses John Marston as a proxy to experience it. This isn't necessarily bad at all and the game is still interesting and enjoyable, but it's lacking a main focus. Is John or the Wild West the real star of the game?

The lack of actual gameplay is also a major downfall. Most of the game consists of cinematics and traveling in the open world with only occasional gameplay sprinkled in between. What gameplay there is is very fun and presented well, but it feels much more like interactive cutscenes most times that aren't even very challenging. The enemies in the game are very easy to kill and the precise auto-aim makes it so you're sure to win every fight you get in. The majority of my deaths were either the result of a glitch (not being able to get into cover; not being able to climb something) or doing something stupid (running out in the open toward the enemy). I even stopped using auto-aim for most missions and tried killing enemies by just pointing my gun and moving around manually to aim. The only missions that present any real difficulty are some of the last few in the third part, and by then, you're so good at the game you know how to handle them.

There are also plenty of glitches and annoyances. Skinning animals, looting corpses, and picking flowers consists of a 2-10 second cutscene, depending on which action, that becomes annoying not even a third through the game. Being able to skip this would make the action much more welcoming and much less annoying.  When played for an extended period of time, glitches become more and more apparent, especially on your horse. The path keeping (staying away from people/horses/objects, not falling off cliffs) will jerk you around from time to time, almost to the point of being like the undead horse in Undead nightmare. Cutscenes and dialogue will also, but rarely, be skipped entirely due to a glitch. Animal attacks can still occur during main and side missions. Jumping/climbing and getting into cover can also be glitchy as mentioned before. And of course, there are more, and some I never even experienced.

All together, Red Dead Redemption is an amazing game with a great story and even better atmosphere. Its downsides may be numerous, and more features, such as mission selection, may have been nice, but none of them overwhelm the experience so long as it captures you into its world, which it's very good at doing.

It is fairly immersive. The key here is if you have the time.  I ended up logging nearly 60 hours on this one, which took a long time playing casually over time.  I did play all the side quests and exploring though.

The main story missions are a lot better than the side missions.  The side missions and planets to explore are generic, uninspired, and repeat, but yet I still had fun exploring all of them.  You see the same base or ship configuration over and over when exploring.

The game is pretty easy on the default setting once you level up a little bit and get upgraded weapons.  I found it very difficult early on to pass the first major set of enemies I ran into at the end of the first planet I landed on, but afterwards was a near cake-walk on the shooter aspects because I kept leveling up and getting better armor, weapons, upgrades, etc.  You collect loot from enemies you kill and can sell it and buy more.  But there is little need to purchase because you find enough better weapons anyway and just use them.  It is a little annoying to trek back to a shop keeper that likes you that you can sell for a higher price.  In the end I ended up maxing out my money since I rarely spent anything in the game.

It is a little tedious to wait in elevators, watch the docking and undocking animations over and over, etc.  I wish I could jump more directly onto the ship and off rather than docking, embarking/decontamination, elevator, then taking a fast transport to where you want to go.

The game adapts a bit to your choices, so there is more replay value to play again with different choices.","Very Good, Lots to Do, and Long -- If you have the time.",1258675200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Red and Green only came out in Japan. Not the US. The graphics are much worse then the Red and Blue graphics. Many pokemon looked ugly,and stupid,so Nintendo made Pocket Monsters Blue. There Blue is our Red and Blue. The graphics for Blue,is the same as the graphics in Red and Blue. Some glitches were also fixed in Blue version,and was passed over to R/B versions. The only differences is the language. That's it. Pocket Monsters Red and Green are different from Red and Blue. Pocket Monsters Red is like pokemon Red,but different. Different dialogue,glitches,and graphics. The games became successful,and Nintendo released more games.

On TV TOKYO,pokemon became a Anime in 1997. It became a hit,and was followed by Pocket Monsters Yellow in 1998. Electric Solider Porygon came out in December 12,1997. The bright blue and red lights caused seizures,a symptom when something the human brain cannot take recations. It causes all sorts of sideffects. Many Japanese children got headaches. As well as eye strain,vomiting,bloody noses and bloody mouths. Over 600 children were rushed to the hospital. No one died,but we're hurt. It hit the news in America,and many people criticised pokemon. They thought the Japanese series shouldn't come out in the US. 4Kids still released the pokemon anime in 1998,and still became a hit. However,the episode never came out anywhere outside Japan,even with repaired animations. It wasn't Porygon,but Pikachu. Pikachu used a thunderbolt attack,which hit the missile,and caused the bright lights. It went on for 5 seconds,and caused seizures. Don't watch the episode. It's not safe,for kids anyways. What's this have to do with Red and Green? Well,a story like this with the games were very similar. Lavender Town Syndrome. This is a myth,not true. The myth is about the music from Lavender Town. The myth is is that children who listened to the music got headaches from the load music straining on the Nintendo GameBoy systems speaker. This caused children to kill each other. This isn't true. If this was true,there would have been news reports on it,and pokemon would have been bann. Including Red and Blue. No one died. It might have been annoying to listen to it,but nothing happened. The Japanese music is not the same as the American music. The American version isn't a strong. Anyways,pokemon still was considered violent. But,this has nothing to do with the Syndrome. It has to do with the Cards,Games,and Anime. Watch this one YouTube:Pokemon on the news. Look for pokemon news report 1999. It will talk about it. For one thing,they are all trolls. They all say pokemon wrong. They also say how violent and brutle it was. It's not a message of violence. It's clearly rated E for everyone for every box. Well sure,you go around catching monsters and they beat the crap out of each other,but really,it's not like there killing each other. They aren't. Also,the games are good to improve reading skills. It's bann from every single School across the country. 16 years later and it's still bann. Mostly the Cards. All for violence? Really? No. Not worth it. Well,4 months after the insistent,pokemon was back on in Japan in April of 1998 on TV TOKYO. Then,in September 8th of 1998,pokemon hit the US as a popular Anime.

But how about talking about the games? The games are the same as Red and Blue. Sharing the same Character's,music,plot,trainers,and towns. Want to know why it's called Red and Green? Red is the boy you play as. He is aiming to catch 'em all and become a pokemon master. He has a rival called Green who wanted to train pokemon to the limit. The two main characters are Red and Green,so the games were  named after them. Pocket Monsters Yellow came out to be like the Anime,was became a success. It featured Pikachu as the games mascot,he has his own voice,you can get all three starters,and has better graphics. Thanks to the popularity,Pocket Monsters Stadium came out the same year. It came of for the Nintendo 64,and it had only 43? Pokemon. It wasn't big,so in 1999,Pocket Monsters Stadium2 came out to have all 150 pokemon. Pokemon Stadium,which was made in 2000 in America is Japan's Stadium 2. Stadium in America has all the pokemon expect for Mew and Mewtwo. In 2000,Pocket Monsters Stadium:Gold and Silver came out,having all new pokemon. In America,that was Stadium 2. Pocket Monsters Trading Card Video Game was made,having fans play pokemon Cards on the go. This was released in 1999 for the Nintendo GameBoy Color. Pocket Monsters Snap came out in 1999,having the player take pics of pokemon in 3D. Pocket Monsters TCG came out in 1998,and was huge. There were tons of Cards to collect,and trade,which made them so popular. In fact,the Holographic Chazarid is really the one that was popular. It was so rare,so not many fans could find them in packs.

Thanks to Pocket Monsters Red and Green,pokemon became huge. For a game that was made in 1996,it's still fun. However,there's more to talk about. After the first episode of Pocket Monsters came out in Japan,Ho-Ho,a second gen pokemon was seen flying in the sky near a rainbow. Most fans have beaten Red and Green,and that wasn't one of the 150 pokemon. Nintendo announced Pocket Monsters 2:Gold and Silver. They were suppose to come out later that year of 1997,but failed. It wasn't until 1999 when Pocket Monsters Gold and Silver hit stores. These games were different then originally planed. There was many different pokemon designs,and towns,and route designs,as well as different graphics. Nintendo failed with this,and only 100 new pokemon were made. However,it was made for a more advance system,the GBC. These games had color,shiny pokemon,genders,New gym leaders,bugs fixed,two new types,Speical split,eggs,and registrationing items. It was a hit,and in 2000,Pocket Monsters Crystal came out with the choice of beging a girl,battle Animations,bugs fixed,more storyline with Suicone,and even a even with Celebi!!!! A new Anime,called pokemon Johto Journeys came out the same year as Gold and Silver,1999. Pokemon The movie 2000 came out in Japan in 1999 with new pokemon. Another moive,called Mewtwo Strikes back came out in 1998. These moives were in theaters,both in Japan and the US. Pocket Monsters Puzzle Leauge came out for the Nintnedo GBC,around when Stadium G/S came out. It was alot like Tetris.

In 2002,Pocket Monsters Ruby and Sapphire were made,and had more things,like double battles,new pokemon,pokemon contests,and more. Pocket Monsters Colosseum was a spin off for the 3rd gen in 2003. 3rd gen is when the series started to die down. However,with the help of Pocket Monsters Fire Red and Leaf Green,it made it more popular. They were remakes of Pocket Monsters Red and Green. They were hits,having everything,old,new. These games were released in 2004,for the Nintendo GameBoy Advanced. The same year,Pocket Monsters Emerald came out,as a squeal to Ruby and Sapphire and is suppose to be amazing. Pocket Monsters XD Gale of Darkness came out for the Nintendo GameCube in 2005,with a storyline of Shadow Lugia.

In 2006,Pocket Monsters Diamond and Peral came out for the Nintendo DS. This was many fans first pokemon games. They were hits,and sold around 16 million copies. In 2008,Pocket Monsters Platuim came out,as a better installment. It was much more fun then D/P. In 2009,something new happened. Pocket Monsters Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out as remakes of Pocket Monsters Gold and Silver. They were hits,letting you have pokemon out of there pokeballs,like in Yellow. They were the remakes for the 10th anniversary of Pocket Monsters.

For 2010,Pocket Monsters Black and White came out,it was a disappointment for fans. Thankfully,Pocket Monsters Black 2 and White 2 came out in 2012 as squeals. They allowed fans to catch more pokemon,and a inverter story. They are much better.

For 2013,Pocket Monsters X and Y came out worldwide,as the first Nintnedo game to be a worldwide launch. It was boring,in my opinion,and it wasn't very good. Pocket Monsters Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire came out in 2014,another worldwide launch. They were also not fun.

For 2015,Pocket Monsters Super Mystery Dungeon is coming out in fall of 2015 for Japan,and Hoilday season for the US in 2015. 2016 is the 20th anniversary of pokemon,so,maybe a Yellow remake or another Red and Blue remake. Then,a Diamond/Pearl remake.

For these games,they are classics,and are fun to play. If you can't read Japanese,or don't know what Red/Blue are like,play Red or Blue first,and memorize the game. Also,learn to write Japanese,to understand it better. Remember to buy handbooks. Anyway,good game.",The very Beginning of a well known Craze:Pokemon,1438732800,,,

Exile is definitely one of my favorite computer games; the graphics are beautiful, the music is excellent, the acting is exceptional. While it retains the linking books, creative ages and puzzles that define Myst, it has a different personality and, in my opinion, is superior to its oldest predecessor. It has overall excellent replay value, so rest assured you can play it over and over and still have fun.

There are five ages in Exile, not counting Atrus's home; J'nanin, Amateria, Edanna, Voltaic and Narayan. J'nanin is the hub age of this game, with a total of four linking books placed in giant ""tusks."" Puzzles must be solved before you have access to the books.

Amateria is my favorite age and bears a remarkable resemblance to Giant's Causeway in Ireland. It is a peaceful and relaxing age, with great background music and glowing crystals.

Edanna is the least conventional of all the ages. It is a towering tree-like thing, the interior of which is full of plants.

Voltaic is an age of red rock and metal. Not surprisingly, there is also lava.

Narayan is the smallest age, and also my least favorite, which you cannot access until you have completed all the other ages.

5.0,False,"02 19, 2006",A1JFYUBZJ8XGA3,B0007TFLLC,Mindy E. Brown,"The psp is just awesome to look at. Its sleek black design is just begging to be touched. It does smudge easily, but as long as it doesn't get scratched, who cares? You can always wipe it off.

I'll go through every one of the things that comes in the psp value pack.

Console: Yeah, its pretty sweet looking. I actually would have better liked a flip screen so the screen wouldn't get as smudged, but it takes away from the weight and still looks sleek.

Music: I've only put a couple songs on it so far, but the interface is pretty nice. It can do the basic features, nothing more, but its enough.

Video: With the amazing widescreen display, anything will work good. I definitely reccomend not getting a umd movie. They don't play on dvd players and there aren't as many special features. They also are a lot at about 30 dollars. I reccoment buying a 1 gb memeory stick pro duo off of amazon, and puting on dvd movies that way. Dvd's are much cheaper. Check out [...] if you want to put video onto a memory stick duo.

Photo's: I haven't put any on yet but I'm sure photo's look great. As far as I'm sure, the interface is nice.

Gameplay: The reason you would get the psp lives up to its standars and easily surpases them. You get nearly a ps2 experience anywhere you want, and that's awesome. Loading times aren't as bad as you would think, but there are loading times.

Web Browser: With all new psp's bought, the new firmware is pre installed, including a web browser. This is a very nice addition. Typing is not as bad as it could have been. Pins like [...] and .com and about every single one you can imagine are there, with a cell phone style keypad. Overall its very good.

Now, onto the stuff included in the box.

Case: This case is just okay. Its small, and all your gonna fit is the psp with one game and one memory stick duo in it. Its fine once you just get the psp, but soon you're gonna want to upgrade.

Cloth: Well, it's just a cloth. It seems to work fine, takes off those smudges well enough.

Headphones: They're quite nice, look just like iPod ones. Sound quality is actually quite good compared to most included buds. Of course I found myself reaching for my favorite earphones, but these are still good.

Remote: It performs basic features, nothing more. But they are all exucuted well.

Game demo disc: It's pretty good actually. The game demo's are cool though I would've liked a playable one. The movies are very nice looking, like a tv. The music videos are good too.

Wriststrap: You know, it seems so pointless, but I'm glad its there. It's better to wear a great looking wriststrap then to have your psp fall to the ground, at least that's my opinion.

Charger: It does what its made to do, I like how you could play the psp while its charging. You know what would be sweet? Bluetooth. To a wireless charger. Yeah...that would be cool.

Battery: I don't know the times, but it seems good. It could be better, it's around six hours, i think

Basically it's a great system. This is my first sony system and it took me no time at all to master the x,sq, circle, and tri, so don't let that take you away from it. Add video, music, photo's, internet browser, wireless gameplay, game sharing, and you've got everything that you could ever want in a multimedia system.

There was just one other flaw though. Not the system, just the included accessories. This psp, its got the nicest screen ever, like 6 million colors. I would've liked to see a screen protector included in the pack. For what you're paying, you should at least get something to protect the screen while your playing. That's an extra 10 dollars you are paying for a screen protector which is really important. I would've taken out the cloth and added the screen protector instead.",awesome...some minor flaws but nothing bad,1140307200,4,,

Pros
1. The story is above average. Especially for sanbox-style games like this one.
2. The game play is fantastic. In most cases it plays like a Grand Theft Auto game except for the unique parts like sweeping crime scenes and performing interrogations. The parts that play like GTA are familiar and fun while the unique parts are fascinating and enjoyable.
3. The game is very long and there are a lot of side quests.
4. The facial graphics are phenomenal. Ahead of its time and totally awesome. In some cases it feels like actually acting instead of 3D modeling.

This usually was fine for me until I got tired of my team mates not being able to hear me or vice versa, and not being able to pin point where sounds are coming from.

So, I decided with a little bit of birthday money maybe it was time I finally invested into a pair of excellent gaming headphones. I looked everywhere, for hours looking for the perfect pair and finally I landed on these or the A50's, I realised then that I would have to pay more money for a feature I don't even need (wireless) thus, I decided these were the best bet. (Wired has ZERO problems with cutting out, hissing or being off sync, so in a way the A40's are actually better than the A50's)

I looked around and was able to find a pair on the used -very good page of GAMINGUSA for $99, I simply had to try them for over half off.

I received my package yesterday morning and I was actually surprised that all they did was tape the actual Astro box closed, they didn't use a packing box. ""Oh boy, here we go"" I said expecting a mess on the inside. I was pleasantly surprised to see everything was completely unused and untouched. It was perfect in every way and included everything!

Setting up the headset was a breeze, plug in the headset to a USB on the back of your Xbox One (I have the Xbox One X so there is plenty of USB's if you don't have one you can plug it into most newer TV's or just a simple phone charger you can buy at pretty much any store for under $5) then I plugged in the Optical cable on the back of my unit and my Xbox. The Xbox found my headset and assigned it and I was on my way! One thing to make sure of is you have it set up to Bitstream and Dolby in your sound settings. Most of the one Star reviews are because they didn't follow this direction.

I plugged the A40's into the Mixamp and WOW is all that can be said. The bass is booming, the mids are clean and the highs are crisp. The best thing about them is how easily I can pinpoint any sound in my vacinity in PUBG, making the game much easier in every way.

Should you buy them? Hell yes, there is NO BETTER headset out there right now, Turtle Beach can't even touch these in the sound department.

This is an action shooter style (I always assumed it was FPS), and of course a horror style game. Loved the different weapons, and how you have very limited ammo and upgrades so every decision you make you have to live with it. Use the wrong gun on for the wrong situation, really complicates game play later. I am not a fan of horror movies, so I assumed I would not like this game at all. Again, I was wrong, the story line was fun and the suspense was intense. At first, I could not play the game longer than 2 hours because it was too much for my nerves. After a while, when I got used to it I really fell in love with this style. My wife walked in a few times to me playing, watched for 30 seconds and turned around and walked out.

Let me tell you, I'm soooo happy I went with this. It's much different from all the other racing games I've ever played and I've played a lot. It's the missing piece to a gamers racing collection.

The car selection is massive, the amount of tracks is much larger than most games including the huge game coming up - Project CARS which has less than half the tracks Forza Horizon 2 has. Not to mention the stunning detail of not only the cars but scenery.

My most memorable moment so far:

I was driving an off road challenge, classical music started playing, engines running and we're off. Beautiful sun in the distance, we're going into a field, a group of us are hitting against each other and the climax of the epic Beethoven song creates a moment of nirvana I'll never forget.

ANYWAY! This game is fantastic, huge roster of fighters, cool music, difficulty ranges from cake walk to controller throwing - rage inducing - I finally got it glory. Forget about the story, I still don't really know the entire background of what is going on. Apparently Jin is the kid of Kazuya (Thrown into a volcano by his own Dad)and Jun (Whom he raped and is now dead). See, totally confusing.

JUST PLAY YOUR FAVORITE FF GAME IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, IF NOT DON'T BASH THIS FOR NOT GIVING YOU THE SAME FUZZY FEELING. GET READY FOR A NEW FUZZY FEELING. I have been playing RPG's for about 10 years, since the first KOTOR got me into it. At first I was really hesitant to get into the any Final Fantasy games. It just seemed too kiddy, the character design was fruity, it seemed like a mish-mash of fantasy / sci-fi that just clashed, and was filled with mellow drama (all the same reasons I don't like any current anime series). I tried 11 and gave up 25 hours in. Then I tried 12 which I played the h*ll out of. It was HUGE, had a top-notch story and cinematics, was very original, and really gave you way more than your moneys worth. It was too much game for me, but I was happy not completing every little thing or getting fully leveled. I still beat the game and enjoyed almost more than any other game. So I played 13 and it surpassed my every expectation. The story and the way it's told was the best I've seen in a game, and rivals the best of fantasy / sci-fi movies. The characters were well developed, realistic, and extremely well voiced. The fully rendered cut scenes are the best out there and plentiful. In the current gaming world, where games are rushed and buggy, good designers are undervalued, good writing is none existent, and programmers are a dime a dozen, this game shows how good a game can be if you do it right. A major complaint about it is that it's too linear, as other final fantasy games are very open. The leveling is very linear as well and doesn't allow for personalization. To me this wasn't a minus. It kept me out of the menu, worrying about what the pros and cons of some level would do for the overall progression of my character, and kept me in the game, experiencing this awesome world they've created. There is plenty (arguably too much) customization in the equipment and tactics anyway. As for the linear level design, it REALLY opens up late in the story. You can play +100 hours, in varying, beautiful environments, with ever-greater challenges just waiting for you. I think the root of this complaint is people that were huge fans of 12 and wanted a similar game play (don't let your expectations ruin an amazing game). The battle system, though turn based is fast paced, and engrossing. The scaling of difficulty is well done. Once you get good at the tactics you can battle monsters that would be otherwise way out of your league. This is 2012 and there still is no RPG this good out on the current systems.

On PS3 the game looked sharp and honestly didn't feel old especially for a rpg since normally visuals take a backseat for example Disgaea another popular rpg, but then again one shouldn't be surprised of Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix visuals since it does hail from the critically acclaimed Square Enix which was previously known as Square Soft whom's more recent titles includes the very well received Hit Man Absolution, and 2013's Tomb Raider, as well as classics such as Chrono Triger, Final Fantasy 10, and Final Fantasy 7. I honestly never feel as if the games outdated in fact it's not till a friend reminds me how old it is that I notice, the textures are just great as well as the animation that brings Sora, Goofy, Donald and the rest to life. Also unlike the previous Compilation which included the first 3 chapters of this amazing saga (Kingdom Hearts 1.5 Remix) gone are those few moments where you'd notice ugly stretched low detailed character models, both the cutscenes models and the in game models match them selves well and blend much better, the only real gripe is probably the fact that not all cutscenes are voiced and this goes for the previous compilation as well but it's understandable given the fact that a lot of Disney voice actors are brought out of retirement and one could only imagine how much that must cost to begin with. Also the game runs at 30 frames per second so sorry to those looking to find it running at 60 few but honestly the game runs so fluidly that there's really no need for that , did have one moment during a later world you visit where I felt there was some slow down during the cutscenes but it might very well  been done for impact. I'm not a old fan of Kh but rather a new fan who just recently got into the franchise when I happened to stumble upon the first compilation for around $20 dollars at the bargain bin of my local GameStop. And decided o give it a shot, since then I've been working my way through them while I want in anticipation for the third and what should be the last chapter to this tell, one last note to understand what is happening within the tales told in this compilation it's highly recommended you get the first, even with the fact I had played the other games I found the story quiet confusing at times.",unbiased non fanboy review,1438041600,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

If you haven't played this game with friends, particularly in versus mode, then you haven't really played it.  There are not many games that ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE you to work as a team.  You can be successful in most multiplayer games if you have a few good players, even if you don't work together so well.  Like Gears, Halo, COD.  The BEST player in the WORLD can't succeed at L4D unless he is a team player, and has three other team players working with him.

This game has gotten as much rotation in my 360 as Gears and COD and Halo.  And that's saying a lot.  Valve throwing in the free DLC in the near future is just gravy.

5.0,False,"06 15, 2016",A3C5PBDQTHXBWZ,B001CRQY1E,James E. Lindsey,"I originally got this game the year it released on Xbox 360. I loved it from beginning to end as the graphics are still pretty in today's standards. However a few things did bother me about the 360 version, but nothing that would stop me from also giving a 5 star review.

One was how easy the game was. Most enemies gave nice EXP and Gold. Taking photos rewarded you even more so. You could level easy from just fighting all the enemies in any given area once. Even Encore Mode which is Hard Mode basically with extra stuff to unlock was simple.

Secondly there was a lot of empty space. Bothing was really filled in. I did not notice it so much until playing the 360 version again recently. Maybe because I had played through the PS3 verson and decided to go back to show my wife the game.

On PS3 the difficulty has been drastically increased even above Encore Mode on 360 and it is very noticeable. For one the second boss of the game on 360 will do about 80 to 110 damage to you if block on Encore Mode for 360. Block it on PS3 on Standard Mode and you are taking 200 damage easy. Fail and it jumps to 1,000. On Encore Mode a block takes about 600 damage. So the boss with a critical on Standard Mode can sometimes one hit KO a team memeber. If very unlucky, possibly both. On Encore Mode never forget to block on PS3. If that was not bad enough though EXP earned is cut even further and Gold from pictures was dropped from often 80+ on 360 to about 8+ on PS3. The first boss for a few good photos netted you almost 4,000 Gold per photo of B Range. On PS3 about 1000 for A Rank. So if you have trouble with beating on PS3, but own a 360, it might be best to get the easier version.

The empty space on PS3 has been mostly filled in with interesting cratures and such.

So you get a second shot at what is probably my favorite 360 game and while enjoying it you, you can even unlock two exclusive new characters.

Edit:
Some important notes playing between both versions. One I forgot to mention is the 360 version uses real photo/video for certain mid/piano scenes. On the PS3 they are stills of the same scenes with a paint modifier for lack of a better term.

The game on 360 is upscaled to 1080p versus the PS3 version which is in 720p. This might sound like a benefit, but what it does is over saturate colors on 360 to give this very bright glossy look. It is pretty, but the PS3 version has more colors and motions plus sharper images with more detail.

Duffel Bag:  Medium-Sized, black bag with a white Rockstar logo outside and a yellow-pattern lining on the inside...surprisingly very eye-catching design.  This will make a great gym bag.

License Plate:  Not as hard as the real license plate, but still sturdy enough to put on your wall or hit somebody with it.

Safe Deposit Box(with 2 keys):  I'm very impressed with this item!  I expected some cheap, easy-to-break deposit box, but it is very sturdy and hard to get into.  I wouldn't trust my valuables with it, but its a nice box to use in your room to keep sensitive items away from other eyes.  Somebody with a screwdriver and some time on their hands would be able to pry it open eventually, but still very stylish and modest safe deposit box.

RockStar keychain:  3-D letter ""R"" logo of Rockstar, which measues about one square inch.

""The Art of GTA"" handbook:  a very nice cloth hardcover booklet that shows how the game was made.  Very interesting material inside.

""The Music of GTA4"" CD:  16-tracks on this CD that comes with a carboard sleeve.

1 Free Month of XBOX Live!  This wasn't listed as part of the offer, so I was surprised to see this.  It is NOT A TRIAL and you can go to your Live account and simply add a month of XBOX Live Gold to your paid time.

Bottom Line:  If you are a fan of GTA and have some money to spend, this is definetely worth an extra $30, especially with an extra month of XBOX Live included.",Review on the goodies that you get with the game...,1209513600,101,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Nonetheless, here we go.

This game is amazing for a portable game. The graphics and sound are just far above what you expect when you think portable gaming and they actually tied the story to the original well too.

Gameplay: The Gameplay is top notch. Not only do you explore towns, talk to NPCs and have the Final Fantasy experience you would expect, but there are also side missions that act as a quick fix incase you don't have enough time to actually focus on the story. You can play these whenever you find a save point and they serve as a nice way to get you some extra potions and experience. Interactivity is similar to what you would find in the classic game as far as finding items by exploring the environment and seeing unique sights because you were curious enough to explore every nook and cranny. There are even side missions like having professor hogo making you face huge monsters in an attempt to kill you because you disturbed him. The Story is what shines the most in this game, and it is by far one of the most engrossing stories of the series.

Graphics: This game seriously looks like the first Kingdom hearts on the PS2. Their facial expressions and animations are the best you can find on a portable system to date. This game could be ported to the PS2 and considered to have gorgeous graphics. The CG scenes are on par with Advent Children.

Sound: The Voice acting is actually pretty good, and the music from Final Fantasy VII that was redone for the game isn't bad either, but the new music to the game is pretty forgettable. I honestly can't stand the shinra building's theme, which feels like it is 10 seconds long and just set to loop. This is one of the game's biggest strengths and downfalls at the same time.

Replay Value: You could speed through the story and still expect hours upon hours to be spent doing side missions. The story itself takes a good amount of time to beat. Expect to invest maybe 30 hours into this game.

This game is a fantastic deal. Expect to have a blast with it and you won't be disappointed.

SPECIAL NOTE: There are some things to this game that you might want to take into consideration. I started playing this game on my old PSP then early into it bought the new model. The difference is HUGE. The load times on the new PSP are cut not only in half, but takes the load time from up to 18 seconds at some points to maybe 3-4 tops. There is also a very low amount of blur when Zack is running around on the screen on the new one compared to the old one. The new screen is brighter, higher refresh rate and the load time on the new one is way shorter. The new PSP is almost a must for this game otherwise load times will destroy the experience.",A Great Prequel,1208995200,113,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

Personal Pros:
- Great clean and beatuiful cartoonish graphics, sound, and play control.
- Many choices of unique Heroes to choose from. Each has their own great personalities and abilities.
- 3 differ game types in which all are done well.
- Quick play and Ranked options. Casuals will enjoy quick play but Ranked with friends is where it's at! Ranked matches are so intense!
- Teamwork and communication is required. In ranked, it's super rare that a single player can completely carry a team. You can be the hands down the best player in the room and still lose. This isn't a COD or being in a vehicle in a BF... it doesn't work.
- Best and favorite feature is the chess match of the Hero match ups. It's not a mindless shooter like a COD. If you're having trouble against a Hero, just choose another Hero counter to him. LOVE this. Nothing really like it.

Person Cons:
- For quick play mode, the option to have the same Hero picked multiple times can be annoying. Good players can counter. Unexperienced players will find this annoying or unfair. Have a full team of gun turrets around or 6 Divas can be a nightmare. I wish they can limit it more like Ranked.
- Solo playing in Ranked. Again, teamwork and communication is important. If you don't have a full team of 6 of your friends, it can be super tough. Teammates picking the lower tier or non helpful Heroes against a standard complete team of 2 high damage, 2 tanks, and 2 healers will lead to a loss.
- Could be me put the point system in Ranked seems a bit broken. Just seems you don't get much for winning a game but lose a ton of points when you lose.",Best online FPS in years,1473552000,,"{'Edition:': ' Origins', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

There have been many great games out there that had won my heart as well as fans from back in the day. Earthbound, Terranigma, Super Mario Allstars, Super Mario Kart, Starfox, Super Metroid, Chrono Trigger and many many others. This is one game that you need to own in your collection even if your not a collector of the old school games. It is one of the best looking, best controlled, and best platforming game i believe of all time for the SNES. (Super Mario World is good but Yoshi's Island beats it) Everything about this game just has it slated as perfect.

1. Great level design - The levels are bright and colorful no two stages look the same everything is different in every portion of the stage.

2. Awesome boss battles & enemies - Fighting enemies from the mario series, Piranha Plants, Koopa Troopas, Para Troopas, Shy-Guys, Chain Chomps, Taking on a Frog that eats you, Baby Bowser, & Kamek.

3. Perfect controls - One of the best controlled games for the Super Nintendo's controller. DPad works great for moving Yoshi, and Buttons are not hard to remember using for attacks or for special tricks you make yoshi use on his enemies (ground pounding, firing frost breath, and etc.)

4. Beautiful Graphics - One of the best Graphics games on the SNES system other than Terranigma and Starfox. (All of these games being on a 16 Bit System. Just Goregous!)

For example,  when you start the game, you can't do that much but jump and attack, making dodging rather difficult. Later on, when you gain enough levels,  you learn the ability to roll and parry attacks, making dodging and defense much easier. Even later, when you gain even more levels, you learn the ability to float around, making the attack and defense strategy change around yet again. the challenge is not as hard as the people say it is, and the only real challenge is the last boss (obviously), the ice titan from hercules, and most of all, sephiroth from final fantasy VII (im on level 70 and i still have trouble beating him, but its fun nonetheless). this game produces maximum fun, and a GREAT story. i recommend you buy this game, and not borrow it from a friend, because i have beaten it, i love it, but i don't own it, and the feeling sucks. cant wait till the second one comes out, its going to be great",top-notch compared to the crappy new games out there,1087516800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

WarioWare Touched is perhaps the craziest DS game ever created, a barrage of 5-second microgames one after another. There are 180 of them, all with strange goals like running a mechanical pencil out of lead or popping balloons. Some other reviewers have complained that this game is too easy, but I disagree. Sure, I was able to beat all the sets of microgames once in the first day I had it, but that's only scratching the surface. After you beat a Boss level or complete a set number of games, you recieve a weird souvenir, which could be anything from a party blowout to a parrot that repeats whatever you say into the DS's microphone. This keeps you playing even after your first run through the game, trying to beat challenges and unlock more extras. I still don't have them all. I still haven't even played all the microgames.

  Another cool feature of this game is the fact that only the touch screen and the mic have any importance in the game controls; everything else just pauses the game. While this makes for a fun, different way to play, you should be careful not to get too carried away in trying to beat the clock, or else it's easy to scratch your screen. I know. I've been very, very careful {or have tried to be, anyway}, but my screen still got some scratches. Oh well. This game is worth it. This isn't a story-oriented game like Super Mario 64 DS {which, by the way, is an awesome game}, but it'll keep you playing for quite some time.

5.0,False,"05 18, 2010",A1KKE6VX8VPWZK,B001SGZL2W,Joe Marino,"Synopsis:
From the team that brought you Grand Theft Auto, you are now thrown head long into a wild west adventure. You control John Marston. This game is set in the desert in 1911 (same year as my favorite .45 was made). You are somewhere near the Mexico border. John was a criminal that ticked off many people in his past and now has to atone for what he did. People come out of the woodwork either as his friends or enemies.

My play experience:
On the PS3 the graphics are really sharp and crisp. The textures, the ambiance all bring the wild west to your home living room.

In recent years there have been games that have tried to capture the essence of the western genre. For example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Juarez-Bound-in-Blood/dp/B001RTCOWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood</a>&nbsp;which on the surface was a pretty good game, it however was not a very good story. In COJ the main characters are brothers that are ex-confederate soldiers. The story never really grabs hold and to be honest I never finished COJ. The story in Red Dead Redemption is done so well that it never feels pushed or contrived. Instead its done like an old western movie. Its gritty and a world that beckons you back time and time again.

For now let me discuss the cool features:

Horses: +
I think they put a horse into a motion capture room and had him run around. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assassins-Creed-II/dp/B00269DX5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assassins Creed II</a>&nbsp;the horse was a good way to get from town to town and the motion was pretty real. In Red Dead Redemption its super smooth an you feel like your out exploring the desert on a horse with no name... Kick your horse too much to get him to chase down that coach, you could be looking at a wild ride as he tries to buck you off. The longer you keep 1 horse the more stamina and other abilities it gets.
EDIT: I see they actually DID use a live horse to make the motion capture. It shows.

You can also ride stage coaches and trains. Or rob them, its up to you. See gameplay below.

Gunfighting: +
You are a real gunslinger in this game. To get prepped to get it I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Guns-Blu-ray/dp/B000H5TVL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Guns [Blu-ray</a>] and a couple of other westerns. This game matches the combat of say GTA and COD. Where you shoot someone matters, and it can affect your character in different ways too. Some of my opponents are gonna have a limp for a while at least.

Atmosphere: +
There are critters running all over as you ride through the desert landscape. It feels dusty, makes me want to wear a bandanna as I play. When you get low on cash you can kill and skin critters for a few coin. There are actually many ways that you can earn money in this game besides being a hard criminal.

World: +
So far its just massive. I can only compare it to the run from Commonlands to Qeynos in EQ. It seems to be fully explorable and I have found very few places I couldn't go. It really is huge. I have seen that someone said it was the biggest world ever done in a Rockstar game. Which is impressive considering that those games can go on forever. The land is great in that it hardly ever repeats as you ride. Matter of fact I haven't seen any textures or vistas that look the same. Maybe there are but they are so far apart that you won't notice it. An example of this is the train ride into the mountains in Uncharted 2.

Towns: +
Unlike GTA you won't have a huge city to run around. Out west these were small settlements and usually had only a couple of hundred people in them. Think about all the old wild west movies you have seen where there is maybe 10 shops and a few houses in the town directly. The way they did the towns is very endearing, because it makes it an immersion type of game experience.

Poker: +
I love the side games. I have lost my fair share of my real money playing poker and now I can do this in game too.

Gameplay options: +
You can be the good guy or be a down right criminal. The game system supports either mode and varying degrees in between. This allows RDR to be more than just a shooter, but more like an RPG. Be careful who you pull your gun on. If you do it in town you can start something that will ultimately lower your honor.

Controls: +/-
The controls are a bit different here and do take some time to figure out. But any game can be that way. If you go from say a driving game to a shooter you might hit the wrong buttons once and a while. After playing this for nearly 2 days solid now and not switching to other games in between, I have totally become comfortable with the controlling scheme.

Multiplayer: NA
I do not enjoy multiplayer shooters. I am really no good at it so I tend to not play it much or at all. That being said I jumped in a couple of games and it was ok. If your a hard core multiplayer person please check other reviews for this. I would not do it justice because I tend to be jaded with regard to multiplayer games.

Replayability:

I am almost done and I can see where I would have like to do something different in the way I played this. That being said, I think that I could go back through and try it again maybe being a bit evil this time. For that I think that this is a game you could play over and over, adjust the story line, and enjoy it each time you did.

Summary:
This game is really appealing if:
A. You enjoy GTA type of game play, open world and a morality system that challenges you.
B. Fan of westerns and cowboy movies. If you hate them and think they are silly then you probably wouldnt enjoy this.

If you are A+B then this game is a hands down favorite pick to have in your PS3 arsenal.

Some Tips: (no spoilers)
I have almost 30 hours into this game and I am not done. I do goof around alot and like to go hunting and see what other mischief I can get into. Playing poker for 3 hours doesnt hurt either. That being said I want to drop some tips in to help those of you still waiting or are looking.

Horses:
1. Dont get to attached to your horse. Think of them like a car, reason being there are tons of ways they can die. From random mountain lions, to getting shot by the enemy to you shooting them in the back of the head on accident when wolves are attacking (sorry skippy :( )
2. When going in to attack a gang leave your horse way back and run up. When you have hog tied your bad guy you can whistle ^ arrow and he will run back over to you.
3. If you buy a horse the deed is in your bag, click it to call your horse back from the dead. (thanks S.L.V)

Gambling:
Like in real life its alot about luck so go in with the thought you'll do 1 buy in and when that money is gone leave, go kill some stuff and come back later. Your hands may improve

Time:
1. Pausing the game with the start button will show what time it is. Saving the game gives you 6 hours of rest. If you like shopping be sure you go to bed no later than 3am. Then when you get back up the stores will all be open, and you can go out and have a blast.

Camp:
Camp whenever you have a long ride ahead of you. As long as you have bought a map you can go to that place from your campground. Once in your campground you can select where to go without having to burn up the 6 hours of sleep. Then after it loads you will be at your destination. Good stuff.

Thats it for now. If I figure out any more lil tidbits Ill share them here with you. Have fun, it really is a great game.

I consider the Ninja Gaiden series the best 3D action hack and slash games in the world (no, it's not God of War. Devil May what?). The latest is no exception and brings the action few steps above previous games. Like most of the other reviewers have said, all the Ninja Gaiden games are hard, but very enjoyable once you learn the system and moves. You can button mash but it won't get you very far before you see the ""game over"" sign repeatedly in your face. Ninja Gaiden series is really a deep fighting game mashed into an action game.

When it arrived, it had a brown smudge on one side of the Nintindo Wii Nunchuck, & a black smudge on the other side. I managed to clean the brown smudge off with a damp cloth, but the black smudge took a Mr. Clean Magic Sponge to get it off. I prefer stuff in its original, UNopened box. I would have ordered this from someone else if I had known this was not the case on this order. It IS a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck with the Nintendo logo at the bottom of the plug.

5.0,False,"12 17, 2012",A7EY4EHYMEWZQ,B002BRYXOO,Skitz,"Wow. Just WOW. You know how games like Harvest Moon are addicting and tons of fun? Well...I thought Rune Factory was the pinnacle of games like that. I never met a Monster Hunter game before that's for sure. There's just too much to do, & it's even worse cuz you're actually gonna WANT to do it ALL for once, even if you're not that type of gamer. This is like rune factory but the battles are a million times more epic. Farming, mining, fishing etc are still all important but there's nothing like slaying a dragon or leviathan underwater and carving its flesh with your knife for resources. The graphics are amazing. Well lit, well coloured, weapons, armor and monsters are highly detailed, music is wonderful and changes to suit the mood of the game very well. Monsters are HUGE, but that's ok, cuz your weapon is just as big lol.

It's a very strategic game with a deep free roam battle system. There's an uncountable number of items for you to forge, find, and combine, it never gets old. The online mode though I must say is half the reason this game is so good. This has to be the deepest, realest, and by far best online gaming experience I've had with the Wii hands down. I don't think anything will beat it either. This game launched in 2010. We're almost at 2013 now & there's LITERALLY HUNDREDS of people still online today playing EVERYDAY. It hasn't gotten boring. The best part is that Capcom did away with friend codes! It feels like you're playing a PS3 because adding friends is so easy in this game and you can track your friends, message them, teleport where they are, trade items and so on. It's amazingly deep. And boy oh boy don't even get me started on the world map. HUGE AS HELL, and gorgeous from head to toe! I won't reveal any spoilers but you really feel like a hunter in the wide open natural world of monsters. They did it so well I sometimes just play around in areas just to watch how pretty it is.

Online gameplay is also just as important as offline since online is part of the story mode. In the game you play as a hunter in a village taking quests from the big guild in the city that oversees everything. I always wondered where the city was before I owned the game. Online is the city, and like a city, it's very lively with players from all over the world walking up and down, sleeping, some sitting, some drinking, others chatting with friends, some going out to hunt together, you can't go wrong with this game. I've owned this game for 3 days and already have over 63 hours of gameplay under my belt. Do the maths. THAT'S how addicting it is. I've completed so much and still there's so much more left to do. This game easily has over 150 hours of gameplay from where I'm standing. I've heard people say it's actually well over 200 hours long.

Get this game. There's nothing like hunting with your friends and communicating and planning strategies during big fights together, being backed into a corner against a gigantic monster together and barely making it out alive, as a team. It's the best thing I've ever seen capcom do. And the Wii speak and usb keyboards are supported by the game so chatting during gameplay is easy as pie. I was hesitant at first to buy this, because I tried it once & it felt boring. I heard someone say it's a slow-to-start game. It really is, cuz after all the bad stuff I said about it I can't put it down lol. Don't be like me, do what's right & buy this game man. I've got a college final in 2 days & can't seem to study yet with this evil game in my room.

It's very comfortable to use, has uses for Gamecube, Wii, and Wii U games (Super Smash Bros), and is a pretty durable controller if you don't abuse it. The cable for this particular one is incredibly long. In my experience, it's almost too long (makes it a hassle to wrap up) but this is just me being pedantic so I can't take off a star for that.

DON'T USE THIRD PARTY CONTROLLERS, THEY WILL BREAK. Spend the extra $5-10 and buy a good, long-lasting first-party controller.

But SF2 was an over night smash back in 1992,1993 or so.. I loved the original, I loved hyper edition, but this Super edition was by far my favorite. But this was the last interest I had with Street Fighter games. There was far too many versions coming out, and I didn't like the animie graphics. But still to this day this is my fav. SF game in the world. Introducing 4 new charactors, Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long and Thunder Hawk. With new an improved sound and graphics and a few new moves. Re drawn backgrounds and cool options. The only thing that was missing was Vega no longer lept on to the cage in his stage, he just bounced of the wall, and a couple of the moves where changed slightly, like Chun Li's blue fart ball was changed into a back flip bubble, and executed differently, and the airiel moves didn't span accross the screen anymore, unless you jumped in that direction.. but it still didn't take away the hours of fun beating the #!@% out of your friends and fire blalling your way to victory.

This game has since been revived on the Gameboy advance. They have pretty much used the SSF2Turbo edition, that has combos and sort of finisher/special move things.

I do wish it comes in more tinted shades like green, yellow, red, etc., etc.  I would've been all over the green or yellow (or even buy different ones to switch around when mood strikes).

Additionally I like how having the case made the vita just a smidgen thicker, which made it much easier to grab/handle.  I noticed I was so worried about scratching it or touching it where I shouldn't with my greasy hands (due to sunscreen sometimes) that it made it harder for me to enjoy myself.  Now that I have the case, not only do I not fear just grabbing it when I need to, but the slightly thicker object was easier to hold in my hands too.  Note that I do not have large hands (i'm a 5'5"" asian girl) but it did not change the fact that I found the Vita to be a little too thin for me to handle without the extra layer of the case.

5.0,False,"01 2, 2016",A3B8SXBDWL1UFC,B00DZIX39E,D.R.G.,"This is an amazing game! I'm probably one of the last people to say so. This game looks stupid on the outside because you don't see your characters. I originally thought so, but with the limited amount of games somehow I converted from my opinion of idiocracity to fan. But the gameplay reminds me of Fire Emblem/Agarest/Final Fantasy. The monsters are 3d generated like in Agarest and then the turns are more like Final Fantasy. But how things work out in the RPG elements are commonly close to Fire Emblem, and Final Fantasy in the character narratives.

The story is very very immersive. There's something about a cute millennium girl had me stuck on the game for 70%. I only got bored around the 70% marker due to the grind. I only hope they re-releacse the rest of the versions because the added voice acting makes the game. One of the reasons I play ads XL games like this is the fact that they're portable. They're easier to put down, and much more mentally challenging so the fact I only went to 70% is really more about personal preferences.",Converted to game.,1451692800,,,

5.0,True,"03 5, 2010",ADFLBRY00Y70G,B001QXNBNI,Matt,"let me just start by saying that anyone who compares BF:BC2 to COD:MW2 is taking the wrong approach and is doing both games a disservice. both have their merits. both are great. both are worth owning. i have both. i love both. i think it should be judged on its own merits, not for what it is or isn't in relation to other FPS's. there, no more COD:MW2 references.

i had an abosolute blast playing BC2, which is really saying something considering that i didn't really care for the original at all.  the single-player campaign is greatly improved.  what stands out to me the most were the set designs and environments.  the colors are all extremely rich, bright, and vivid. you've never seen skies so blue. the weapons are also greatly improved and in my opinion handle much better than the BC1. the single-player campaign offers a nice variety of environments, vehicles [ATVs=awesome], UAVs, challenges [running down a mountain and finding shelter while your sixaxis controller starts to shake and screen slowly ices over was very clever] and baddies and of course it goes without saying that the destructible environments are BC2's money maker. i also have to say that the sound design is amazing. i'm running the game through my 15 year old stereo and it sounds terrific. you really feel the concussive force of RPG landing nearby or a wall being blown out and the guns sound like guns.  lastly, the score, which to me was nice and serviceable, deserves kudos for NOT trying to sound like john powell's 'bourne' score.

the multiplayer is awesome!  i've spent about 12 hours playing so far, so i feel i can offer an informed opinion.  the maps, to me, feel very realistic and probably offer as close an approximation to real thing as you're going to get in a video game.  what i like about the maps are the sheer size -- they are ENORMOUS, so you have to employ a lot more strategy than you normally would.  it won't be enough to run & gun and spray & pray.  as with the single player campaign, the environments are gorgeous to look at and nicely varied. the vehicles are especially fun, particularly the two-man tank and the ATV [yes, you can run over people with vehicles and get the 'road kill' medal].  i also liked the four squad team death match more than i liked 'rush' and 'conquest.' 'rush' and 'conquest' are both fine, don't get me wrong; they're just HUGE [size and people] and can take 20-30 minutes to complete [but that can be fun, too]. leveling up and customizing weapons is pretty standard, so i won't say more than that. it's also cool to choose which kind of soldier you want to be: assault, engineer, medic, recon.

the coolest part of the multiplayer was collecting the dog tags of enemies you melee/knife.  it's VERY satisfying to find a sniper [preferably someone who's already taken you out], sneak up behind them, knife them in the back, and collect their dog tags. very cool! the multiplayer also offers a very nice variety of medals, pins, and honors and keeps track of how many times you've earned each.

all in all, i think this is a GREAT game and a must buy. dice and EA deserve a big round of applause for developing a FUN game [that's what it's all about, right?] that will keep you coming back for more and more.",great fun,1267747200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"07 6, 2015",A1E8EXMWOA7RT7,B00MA5TSFQ,Piaw Na,"Sleeping Dogs is an open world game set in contemporary Hong Kong. The core game play is a Batman-style brawling mechanic with a side-dish of over-the-shoulder 3rd person based shooting. This is a striking combination of two of my favorite mechanics, and the game was on sale (both on Steam/$7 and on PS4/$15).

I bought this game after reading great reviews, and sat down to play it. And play it, and play it. The game's core mechanic as I mentioned before, was great, but what dropped my jaw is the story. If you're an Asian American male, by this point you're used to mainstream media constantly making Asian males (even protagonists played by Jet Li, for instance) effectively de-sexed characters:

  Gene Cajayon, the Filipino American director of the 2001 film ""The Debut,"" the first Fil-Am movie to be released nationwide in the United States, talks about the revised ending for the action movie ""Romeo Must Die,"" a retelling of ""Romeo and Juliet"" where the R&B star Aaliyah plays Juliet to the Chinese actor Jet Li's Romeo. The original ending had Aaliyah kissing Li, a scenario that didn't test well with an ""urban audience."" So the studio changed it. The new ending had Aaliyah giving Li a tight hug. Says Cajayon, ""Mainstream America, for the most part, gets uncomfortable with seeing an Asian man portrayed in a sexual light.""

Well, the writers over at United Front Studios never got the memo. Wei Shen, the protagonist of Sleeping Dogs is virile, manly, and mould-breakingly gets laid with every date (NOTE: Like every video game out there aimed at a mainstream audience, there are no explicit sex scenes, but the dialogue heavily implies what's going on). No wonder the Publisher Square-Enix declared the game a financial failure despite it's amazing critical reviews. Shen is a Chinese American cop from San Francisco on loan to the Hong Kong police department because of his childhood connection with certain Triad members. As he infiltrates the gang and organization, he becomes torn between his personal loyalties to his childhood friends, his duty to the police organization, and his rising position as a ""red pole"" in the triad. This is a fairly familiar story to anyone who's watched any number of Hong Kong movies, but it's very well executed. In particular, Wei Shen is true to Chandler's statement: ""the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world."" The ending is satisfying, even if some aspects of it are predictable, and everything feels true to character. When Wei Shen goes to sleep, he wakes up with memories of recent events haunting him. You cannot help but empathize with what he's going through in order to do this job.

The game is very authentic. For instance, the opening of the game starts in Cantonese. And this isn't lousy Firefly-style acting, but the real deal. The accent is authentic, and by the end of the game you would have learned several choice Cantonese curses if you've been paying attention. Most of the storyline is in English, however, though certain characters who could never speak English would only speak in Cantonese while Wei Shen continues to reply in English (subtitles are provided for the non-Cantonese speakers, of course), which is completely acceptable.  Much of the English is also mixed in with Cantonese by the NPCs in authentic fashion. This is good stuff, and I did not expect it at all. Even the food you can get in the game (Pork Buns, Xiao Long Bao, etc) is authentic. And yes, every time you see Chinese characters in this game, they're correct!

The other parts of the game involving driving, car chases, gunshots and the stuff of epic movie-making, Hong Kong style. There are also side-missions where you do policeman-type duties (hostage crisis, car chases, and drug-busting, as well as serial killer investigations, etc) I didn't care too much about racing, so I didn't volunteer for too many races, but the ones I did were fun and more importantly to me, not set so hard that I got too frustrated. Even the collectible portion of the game isn't too frustrating, with the mini-map unlocking fairly early as a reward for going on dates with various women. As you unlock various martial arts moves and driving and shooting improvements, Wei Shen becomes more and more of a bad-ass. He can jump from a car to another to hijack another car. He can parkour with the best of them. At the highest level of martial arts, he starts making Wing Chun moves like Ip Man, one of my favorite modern martial arts movies. (There's even a costume to go with that!) Did I already mention, and he's good with the ladies? Oh, and he also has to do Karaoke a few times. One of the times he has to do it badly deliberately, and the animation is hilarious.

Speaking of combat: the game really comes into its own in the hand-to-hand martial arts combat. It's very reminiscent of the Jackie Chan movies where you can grab a person and use the environment to attack him. It beats the pants of all the other Batman-like games, including Shadows of Mordor. The opening foot chase sequence is also a lot of fun, and it's a pity that foot chases through a busy urban environment aren't used to as much effect in other games.

The game does have a few weaknesses. The early missions are exceedingly hard if you didn't run around and avail yourself of at least a couple of health upgrades, and drink/eat health and damage potions. This goes away fairly rapidly, but do spend some time looking for and upgrading your health and damage before going on any of the early missions. One of the DLC missions, Wheels of Fury, has a mission that stutters at sub-optimal frame rates, causing me to have to replay it a few times (it unlocks a car that even my wife said was a cool-looking car). The women Shen dates are all effectively one night stands,with no character development. In fact, one of the side mission has Shen stalking one of the women to see her cheating on him (she does, but yes, it's still a creepy thing to do and out of character for Shen) without there having any indication that there was a deeper relationship going on. Finally, the climax boss fight nerfs your hard-earned Dim Mak martial arts skill, which I thought was cheesy.

But these are nits. When I sat down to write the review of this game, I thought I'd write something like: ""If you've ever complained about the portrayal of Asian men in media, put your money where your mouth is and buy this game."" But now that I've thought it over, I realized that the statement would have been a disservice to this game. This is a superlative experience, well designed and executed in almost every way, and easily the best game I've played so far this year. That it's a few years old and hence relatively cheap makes it an amazing value. That it breaks every male Asian stereotype and makes mainstream America uncomfortable is simply icing on the cake. It deserves more success than it has had, and I have no compunctions about tagging it with my highest recommendations.

This one is worth every minute of its 25 hour+ play time (not including extended DLC content that comes as part of the definitive edition), and every penny of its full retail price ($18 on Amazon without any discounts). Buy it, and you'll play the heck out of it.

The definitive edition comes with 2 DLCs that are separated from the main game: Nightmare in North Point, and Year of the Snake. Both DLCs got lackluster reviews, but mostly for being short (90 minutes each). This is no big deal since you're getting it all packaged with the game anyway! Both DLC are somewhat interesting, though it's interesting that since I played them both after the main game they had a milder impact, since I didn't expect to be able to use any of the perks earned in the DLC in the main storyline! In any case, the lack of the RPG aspects in the DLC (you no longer earn any points towards powering up Wei Shen) means you're less likely to do side quests, but on the other hand, the game's core game play is still fun that the game hardly needs to bribe you into picking up the controller and playing the heck out of it. I wouldn't buy the DLC if I had to pay full price, however, so only pick it up if you're picking up the definitive edition for the PC or PS4.",A Superlative Experience,1436140800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

+ online play is top-notch, a true first for a Nintendo game
+ gameplay feels new and familiar at the same time
+ motorcycles and tricks are very nice additions to the series
+ huge character roster including the option to use your Mii
+ the Whiil is a very fun peripheral to use and really opens up the game to everyone
+ 12 player races are really cool

Negative:
- items are terribly annoying and cheap, particularly in single player
- no mission mode
- some control modes have inconvenient button setups

When Mario Kart DS came out in 2005, it not only introduced Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection but also revolutionized the series in many ways. Now that the renowned racing franchise has headed to Wii, does it live up to its predecessors or does it depend entirely on the new Whiil controller to be any good?

The gameplay in MK Wii is very similar to other Mario Kart games, but also feels quite different and new additions add a lot to it. First off, the Wii Wheel, which I simply call the Whiil. This new controller works very well and is very fun to use, but the advanced gamers will gravitate towards a GameCube controller right away. However, I later found that the remote/nunchuk control mode works very well, arguably better than the GC controller, so I recommend you give it a shot if you've been using a GC controller. You can choose between karts and bikes this time, the bikes actually being much better than the karts. With the bikes, you can only get a one-level boost on a mini turbo, but you can do a wheelie that significantly straightens your movement, but also highly boosts your speed on a straightaway. The karts now have nothing special to them, except that they can do tricks as well as the bikes and can get a bigger mini turbo. Tricks are a great addition to the game as well. When you go off a jump into the air, hit the trick button (or shake the remote/wheel) to do a trick. Some of these are pretty cool and they also give you a boost when you land, adding some sense of strategy to the game. Before each race, you can choose whether you want to be able to manually drift and be able to get mini turbos or automatically drift and not be able to get mini turbos, and this option makes the game a bit easier for beginners and makes using the Whiil better.

The single player in MK Wii is pretty much the same as it's been before, only they removed the mission mode that had added a bit more to MKDS' single player. The Grand Prixs were actually not as enjoyable for me this time as I repeatedly get hit by blue shell after blue shell when I should be dominating a race. Otherwise, you have your time trial mode and VS mode, but really that's it for single player. Thankfully there's a whole lot more to the game than the single player.

The multiplayer and online play in MK Wii are absolutely oustanding and easily make up the core of the game. The regular split screen multiplayer is just fine, but it can be hard to see where you're going sometimes because your screen is so small. The online play, however, is easily the highlight of the game. You can play with one or two players from one console, which is a great feature to have available. The only problem with this is that you can't actually be using two licenses (save files) at once, so only player 1 can get his VR up. Speaking of VR, the abbreviation stands for VS Rating. You gain or lose points depending on how you do in a race. It can get tough to raise at some point, though, and you have to constantly win races to continually get it up. The online play goes up to 12 players, a first for a Nintendo game. It is also easy to find people and never takes much time. They have also made it a whole lot easier to play with a friend, allowing you to join the game they are currently playing in, but you can also create a room for just you and your friends where you can chat with select phrases between four race series'. You are even repeatedly told that a friend is playing online. The use of the Mii is also very cool and gives each player an identity rather than just a name.

I guess Nintendo decided that the online play in MK Wii was so good that it deserved its own channel. The Mario Kart Channel allows you to enter tourneys, race the top time trial ghosts in the world, and more. The channel actually appears seperately on the Wii menu, allowing you to access it to check stats and stuff even without a disk.

Technically, Mario Kart Wii really isn't bad, but isn't anything too special either. The graphics are good and all, but I feel that they aren't all Nintendo is capable of, which is still ok with me because I think they're good enough. The visuals are very bright, which makes the gameplay feel pretty nice. The sound in the game is just fine, no problems there. The music is also good but again, nothing particularly special like Mario Galaxy or Brawl. The controls have some minor annoyances as far as the Classic and GameCube controllers go, but the Whiil and remote/nunchuk controls feel just fine. On a GameCube controller, you have to reach down to the D-Pad to do a trick, which is very annoying, especially since the Y button isn't even used for anything and was left wide open for convenience. The Classic controller is the same way, only you have to totally lift your finger off the control stick to hit the D-Pad, which is even worse.

Little difficulties aside, Mario Kart Wii has achieved true excellence. The game is really fun and definitely earns the ""Fun for Everyone"" label (as long as you have multiple Whiils if you're playing multiplayer). Really, I recommend this game for any gamer or non-gamer, but as a more-than-casual gamer, you will need online play to fully enjoy this game. The online play in MK Wii is the best yet, and makes you seriously wonder why Smash Bros. couldn't have had online play like this. So overall, Mario Kart Wii has surpassed my expectations and delivered a game that is as worthwhile as just about any other.

Haven't played (nor thinking about buying that version) but the Wii version is spectacular...Visuals look great, the storyline so far is also pretty good (although it begins with the ""standard"" dumb activities, but these ones are better than windwaker, ocarina of time and majora's mask).

You may be wondering, well how does it work with the Wii-mote? Truthfully, its pretty good, although (first game I've played haven't played Wii Sports) the controls are very intuitive and really EASY to get a grip on...it gets a little not complicated, lets say confusing (for the first 5secs) with the sword, because it requires you to shake it first to wield it, and again to attack.

Another thing that could've been better is when using items, you can only equip one (lantern or slingshot for example) and in order to switch you'll have to access the in-game menu to switch...

Other than that, controls are great. Fishing....! oh my god fishing!!! seriously in previews game i'd rather buy the fish, than catch the fish, very early on the game, you have to fish, and let me tell you, so far so good (can't wait for the bow and arrow).....

This is Zelda, so you have to know for sure, that its a great game, and if just the Wii alone hasn't convinced you to buy the system (although on itself it should) Wii's Twilight Princess should be the reason, the control helps you get more involved in the game (and no, your arms don't get tired)....

*************  EDIT - 9/13/12  *****************
******************************************
I'm level 20 now, and I still think this is a great game!  Combat seems to be a little more than I'm used to when it comes to an MMO, which is definitely a welcome change.  Combat with mobs is actually closer to what PVP was like in WoW - you need to move around!  Learning how to use a new weapon still happens in a matter of minutes.  You equip it, and within a handful of mobs, you've unlocked all the possible abilities linked with it (hot-keyed 1-5.)  Each type of weapon has it's own style of combat.  With a warrior, I prefer a 2-handed sword and either a bow or gun in my secondary slot.

Questing still feels the same, even though I've moved on to the new zone.  It's a bit of a grind at times, but frequently ""events"" will happen nearby.  These tend to involve killing an elite or escorting a NPC, and have a significant reward (XP, Karma and of course, money.)  I actually look forward to these, as they break up the grind a bit, and encourage teamwork.

Teamwork brings me to my next thought!  There's no such thing as ""tagging a mob"" in GW2.  Everyone can take a whack, and if you participate in the kill, you're eligible for reward! (XP, drops, etc.)  This actually encourages players to work together, and not compete.  The same thing goes for resource nodes.  You see a copper or iron ore deposit, you get it.  No fighting or stealing!

I've played WoW and FFXI fairly extensively, so the idea of MMO's isn't new to me (this is likely the case for most people here.)  Guild Wars 2 is my introduction to the franchise, however.  I have to say, so far, I like it!  I'll have to admit, WoW pretty much sets the standard about how I'd expect an MMO to play.  In some respects, this game surpasses it.  In others, it falls a little short (but in no ""game-breaking"" way, however.)  I also have a feeling that I'll update this review from time to time, as the very nature of this game will demand it.

Crafting got a little easier once you get the hang of the ""discovery"" tab.  I chose to make weapons and armor, and I finally figured out that making the components for the weapons or armor pieces of choice, you can combine them with other crafted items and learn new patterns (thanks to YouTube!)  Each discovery gives you 1 of the item that you discovered, the ability to continue making them, AND a ton of XP toward your craft.  This seems like it cuts the resource grind from ridiculous to just very long.  Currently, I'm level a level 46 armorsmith, and have put a significant amount of effort into gathering resources. I need to eventually hit 75 so I can use the materials that I'm gathering in the 15-20+ zone.

Leveling seems to happen a bit faster than I was used to in FFXI, or old school (pre-3.0) WoW.  Each time I've sat down, I've gained at least a level.  Heading back to old zones to farm for copper hasn't been a waste of time, either.  You'll level down to an appropriate level and still earn XP while gathering!  You can even participate in the events for more XP, karma and money, and yet you won't have a significant edge over folks that belong in the area (your gear is better, but you're otherwise gimped to their level.)

Ultimately, the creators made a very solid MMO.  I haven't quite got hooked on it like I did with WoW, but that's a good thing, as I have other things to do.  I plan to continue playing, and updating as I go along.

*************************************************
**************  ORIGINAL REVIEW  ****************
*************************************************

Currently, I have a level 10 character, which I rolled up after abandoning a level 6 character that I didn't like.

**LOGISTICS & TECHNICAL THINGS**

First off, this game has no monthly fee!  Which is great!  I've probably dropped a few hundred dollars in subscription fees for the other two MMO's that I used to pay.  Not having one is great!

I bought the game from a store, and figured the installation would be faster since I wouldn't have to wait for a download at peak times.  I was rather wrong...  I still had about 3 hours between inserting the discs and finally playing; about 2 of those hours were from downloads!

My gaming rig has an AMD FX-4100 CPU, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and an EVGA 550 Ti card, and I'm able to run with the graphics set to pretty high (almost peak) levels.  My GPU hardly notices, though the CPU is running all 4 cores at 50%+ load most of the time.  The RAM is stuck between 3.0 and 3.2GB at any given time.  Not once have I had a dip in frame rates or lag (I set the max frames at 60FPS, just because anything more is completely unnecessary.)  In short, this game seems fairly CPU-intensive, yet not very dependent on the GPU.  (Diablo 3, on the other hand, is the complete opposite.)  My system is by no means cutting edge, yet GW2 runs great on it.

The graphics are decent, though I haven't notices much in the way of physics being used.  The weather effects look a bit dated (I think WoW's environments were nicer, actually.)  Sound-wise, I feel the game lacks.  The music is your standard-fare fantasy RPG symphonic music, and the voice acting is OK at best (in fact, I turned voice volume all the way down and just read the subtitles.)  I can't complain too much here, as lowering the graphical intensity will allow for more players.

**STORY**
The Norn's starting zone is very reminiscent of what you'd expect in WotLK or Skyrim - a winter wonderland filled with things to kill!  The story so far is only OK...  Rather typical fantasy, but fine enough to drive the MMO. The intro has alluded to a menacing dragon and a power struggle.  Again, things seem fairly routine here.

**GAMEPLAY**
When it comes to combat and exploration, the mechanics are fairly intuitive and things flow pretty freely here.  The map has plenty of icons, so once you figure them out,  you should be able to find anything you want.  Fast Travel is very straight forward and inexpensive.  here are several fast travel points through the starting zone, and once you discover them, you can jump to one from anywhere on the map for a nominal charge (5 or 6 coppers, so far.)  The Norn's hometown is connected in a similar fashion.  One thing I found rather strange were the ""Active Events.""  From time to time, you'll get an onscreen notice saying ""An event is happening nearby.""  Said event is usually a raiding party of baddies, or an NPC needing protection.  Anyone is free to join, and participation yields rewards on many levels.  Objectively, watching what's going on is a lot like watching little league ball games - it's just a giant cluster-@!#* of players chasing after mobs!  Regardless, they only take a few minutes, and the rewards are rather nice.

Since this game was recently launched, the servers are getting hit.  Instead of making you wait to log on, they've implemented an Overflow Server.  You can jump right into the game, do all your quests, exploration and what-not, and all of that will transfer over to your main server once your queue pops.  From what I understand, only World Events won't transfer over, though I haven't had to deal with that quite yet...  Ultimately, I'm very appreciative of this Overflow Server idea!  It sure beats the 15min+ queue times that I had to deal with when FFXI and WoW were popular.

Crafting so far hasn't been as clear.  As a warrior, I picked the very original professions of Armorsmith and Weaponsmith.  It seems like you need a tremendous amount of ore in order to make even the most basic item.  Then again, I'm used to crafting in WoW, where you can get started very quickly with a minimal amount of materials.  In the several hours of play time that I've already invested - a good chunk of that dedicated to gathering ore - I've only been able to make 4 inventory boxes, a sword and 2 pieces of armor.  I must've gathered a couple hundred pieces of copper ore.  I have yet to use the Discovery Tab, but I haven't found enough materials to do so.  Hopefully I can make more sense out of the system before long.  After all, I've just started.

Questing is rather silly...  Outside of your ""personal story"" quests, you find a quest giver (empty beige hearts on the map) and do what they say.  You never have to return to them.  Once you complete the objective, you get a message in the mail, which will also include the award.  Speaking of mail, you no longer need to find a mailbox.  It's just a tab at the top of your screen!  Sure, this may lack ""realism,"" but let's face it.  All the realism we had in previous MMO's tended to bog down the game, and just required way more of our time.

**Current Verdict**
As it stands, I'm quite happy with my purchase.  Guild Wars 2, for the most part, is a very well thought out MMO.  You can tell the people who designed this had the player in mind.  If you're here for great sound and graphics, you'll be disappointed.  The story is a little lack-luster, but the over-all gameplay makes up for it.  The crafting system seems a little complicated at the moment, but hopefully I'll sort those issues out on my own.  (I'm wondering of others feel the same way, however.)  They have greatly simplified questing, but again, I feel that they did this to reduce the amount of backtracking we need to do (player-focused design!)  This isn't a perfect game, but it's a very solid attempt.  Considering the fact that they don't require a monthly fee, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for an MMO!",A solid performer (From a MMO Veteran),1346889600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"03 6, 2008",A1ZMCD0RCRI3U2,B000ZJVDA2,R. Francis,"Ah, immortality. The fantasy and desire to live forever is as old as death itself. Books, movies, even religion have all been influenced by humanity's desire to exist beyond a normal lifespan; to see the rise and fall of nations, to witness the advancement of the human race, or simply to dance on your enemy's grave. Even Queen wrote a song about it (see the title?)
Lost Odyssey, however, takes a bit more somber approach to agelessness. Sure, you out-live your enemies, but you also outlive your friends, lovers, even your children. What is immortality then, except watching the endless procession of death with no attainable end in sight? We've all played with the idea in our heads at one point or another, but after reading some of the well written memories that the main character, Kaim, recollects, it becomes easy to see that immortality can really be a downer. Even my roommate, who is as jaded, narcissistic, and cold-hearted as they come, admits that some of the memories are real tear-jerkers. I've read some that bemoan the dramatic writing as melodramatic, and it is true that some of the memories can run a bit long, but they're written that way to invoke a clear picture of the events to the reader. But enough about the memories; while they play a significant role in the portrayal of a less than grand millennium of existence, they're not the meat and potatoes of the game itself.
When I first opened the box I was excited that it took an entire four disks to contain it. Reviewers out there say it is because the world is so big, but that's not really the case. The world itself is average size for a next-gen game, and can be contained on one disk. Really, what would be the point of making a video game world so big that you need to change disks just to traverse it? The first three disks are by-and-large filled with cinematics and cut-scenes. You really don't start exploring the entire world till you get to the fourth and final disk. Until then you're watching a 40 hour long movie with the occasional fighting mixed in to remind you that you're playing a game. While others might complain that there isn't enough fighting in the game, I was happy with it. I don't play role playing games to fight a bunch of random encounters; I play for the story. Get an action game if you want to spend the entire time button mashing.
Overall, Lost Odyssey is a superb RPG that is both nostalgic and fresh enough to keep any fan of the genre happy for weeks. Beautifully drawn characters and maps for those of us that eat up graphics, along with deep playability will keep you glued to your television for hours on end. Just remember to take a break every now-and-then to live your life; it's not like you're gonna be around forever.

I ran it on a 256mb and it was astonishing. Nearly anyone with a somewhat recent PC can play this 1st person shooter and I am sure it will leave most happy that they did. Was it better than Medal of Honour: Allied Assault, as we have heard? Yeah, it is, but not by much, a margin maybe, but still anything that can live up to MOHAA surely can't be missed and COD:UO lives up to the hype.

The concept is the same as MOHAA except that there is more action, more high-octane moments, a different type of enemy AI and a lot more going on in terms of what you can pilot and drive in the story, although not freely but as part of the story. The game play certainly has the Cinematic intensity that it claims including various set pieces like a train bombing run, a lighthouse demolition, the Soviet offensive, all stunning to boot. It is not however HL2 graphics quality or anything close, but does offer a vast improvement over MOHAA, so in that respect is quite good, just nowhere near cutting edge. However COD:UO does have very convincing camera jitters and spectacular smoky explosions. The textures let it down a small bit but the environments and maps are genuinely war like all the way through and can not be faulted. The enemy AI and your own team AI can vary between very helpful and not so helpful but this depends on if you do your job or not. It is actually quite reliable. However, when your team take on an enemy the AI allows each to take multiple hits so that they eventually come into close combat and start hitting each other. This AI must be taken as is, even though slightly unrealistic, the game is not a war simulation but a 1st person war adventure and to be honest, does exactly what it says on the tin. So apart from the staged element, which actually ads to the game, it is more of an experience than a game you will turn to time and time again, however it is worth it for the experience of the single player mission alone.

I can not fault it much except to say that not enough air strike missions, weapons realism is not fantastic and the game was a little shorter than MOHAA (this is a 3 day game span) but to be honest I am only cribbing. The pandemonium of war is all here in a spectacular fashion because the story is a winner as you play a mini version of BAND OF BROTHERS as part 1 and then a mini version of ENEMY AT GATES in part 2. So WOW!

However when a new war simulation like OPERATION FLASHPOINT comes out for high end cards I know we will have the true war winner. Please bring on the real war simulator!

Pros:

- Play the two films mentioned above.

- Best new war game and 2nd best 1st person shooter.

- Awesome war atmosphere.

- Smoky explosions.

- Can run on a 32mb card!

Cons:

- 3 day lifespan.

- Weapons are not so realistic.

- Graphics are not 128mb worthy.

The music, the ""universe"", the characters, the locations, the lore, everything about this game is awesome.

It's a great mix of First Person Shooter, Roleplay, and Survival free-roam. The enemies are vast and unique, from simple giant scorpions, to giant sword made of a car bumper wielding Mutants.

The story is very well done, the players choices making an impact on how the game ends.

Only two complaints about this awesome game though.

1. Game ends upon story completion, no wondering around after story is over.

- artistic watercolor graphics
- cities design are based on the real German medieval village and cities ( another touch of art)
- music is gorgeous and again artistic, no electronic instruments here, most tunes are piano based, only the musical instruments that really existed in a germanic medieval setting
- great innovative battle system, no standard command here, every magic or ability is a single command
- infinite possibility of combos
- the storyline is easily one of the best of all console rpg genre
- very hard turn based game
- duel battle
- strategic battle
- dozen and dozen of characters
- so much innovative
- very generational game ( other than dragon quest v)
- gripping structure ( you must choose the event that occur in the time-line)

The negative
- very few side-quests
- use of pocket- station is needed for play minigames
- strategic battles are a joke before the last one

Eternal Darkness is the mature title that Gamecube owners have been hoping for, with an unrelentingly dark story line and overtones, crisp graphics, and ingenious play mechanics.
Graphically, this is quite a marvel.  Some textures and animations are poor, but overall (especially considering it was ported from the N64) the graphics are smooth as butter and integrate nicely.  When you see immense otherworldly demons or the walls with screaming faces twisting in them, you'll feel truly immersed.  Would have been nice if there were more enemy variety, but there's quite enough in the gameplay to keep you interested.
The story is out there and a bit nonsensical, yet it is tightly told through engrossing cut scenes and the shifting of focus from one character to another.  I wish more action-adventure games used this type of system- it's by far the most unique thing to happen to the genre in quite awhile.
Control is fairly inventive, as well, especially for an adventure title.  The fighting system, which allows you to target individual body parts on the enemies, really seems to reward finesse and reflexes, while the ""magick"" system allows for some interesting combinations and experimentation.  It also allows for some pretty interesting puzzle opportunities.
Puzzles are well-paced and not too difficult, as well.  There were a couple of moments in the beginning where I needed to consult a strategy guide, but after that the sailing was very smooth.  There aren't very many key-hunting puzzles, and things progress in a logical order.  As I said above, the three-color magick system is central to many of the puzzles.  Another bonus is the save system, which doesn't limit you to certain spots and only a certain amount of saves like the blindingly dumb Resident Evil does.  Unless there's enemies nearby you can save at any time, in any place.  Overall, this improves the pacing of the game tenfold.
By far the most interesting addition to the horror genre is the insanity system, which adds some teasingly great effects that could make you scream or toss your controller in anger and frustration.  You'll dig every moment of it, and it really adds some interactive elements to the game.
In sum, Gamecube owners are lucky to be presented with such an awesome piece of storytelling and graphical wonder.  You'll be hard pressed to find similar niche masterpieces like this on any other system.  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.",The overlooked Gamecube classic,1058400000,,,

5.0,True,"06 4, 2007",A1N8PNDWBIQ578,B000MF67VO,J. Harvey,"UPDATE, 4/18/2009: After nearly two years, my DeathAdder has been experiencing problems. The finish is starting to come off of the top of the mouse, and the left mouse button is intermittently cutting in and out such that if I try to click and drag anything, it stops halfway through. Thankfully, the warranty is two years and I will most likely be getting a replacement. However, before you read the glowing review below, keep in mind that you may suffer issues in the long term.

ANOTHER UPDATE, 2/25/2014: Nearly five years later, my DeathAdder replacement is still going strong. Either Razer has improved their mouse manufacturing processes or I just got unlucky last time. Either way, kudos to them. They've also updated their software several times since I first wrote this review, so my gripes about the install are no longer valid and I've deleted them. The Razer software v2.0 works great on PC and Mac (though if you want to get the forward and back buttons to work on Mac, it's much easier to use a free third-party program like BetterTouchTool than it is to try to use macros, which are still hilariously broken).

I'm a gamer, but loathe PC-based first-person shooters. So one might think this mouse overkill for someone like me. However, I splurged on this mouse anyhow thinking it might come in handy elsewhere, be it in Warcraft 3 or just a web browser.

The first thing you notice right after you plug it in is that it looks cool. The scroll wheel is a bright blue, and the Razer logo gives off a soft blue pulsing glow. However, you can turn the lights off in software if this isn't your thing, which is a nice plus.

I've found the mouse extremely comfortable (though unfortunately it's ever-so-slightly curved to one side, which means southpaws need not apply) and very, VERY responsive. It never skips, jumps, or glitches. The buttons are easy to click but not so easy as to cause mis-clicks, especially the two buttons on the left side, which are a bit sturdier. The mouse comes with a  decently long cord with a gold-plated USB connection too; having used wireless mice I must say I prefer this setup to changing batteries, rechargeable or no.

When I first considered buying, I was stuck between this and the Microsoft Habu, mostly because the latter has two additional buttons and a left-to-right tilt wheel. I've tried both, and I must say this is clearly superior, not just in price point but comfort as well. You don't really need the two extra buttons unless you plan on switching the DPI a lot, and according to ESReality's Mousescore 2007 the mouse performs far better in 1800 DPI than 900 or 450, so it's probably better to stick to the highest DPI and change the sensitivity instead. I can't say I miss the left-right tilt wheel either, since the scroll button's click function is a universal scroll in web browsers, and that's just as good if not better.

$45 seems a bit expensive for a mouse, but even for non-gamers, consider how much you use it - it's probably 99% of all user input to your computer, so why not splurge a little on an excellent mouse? Razer is also apparently moving into mice/keyboards/etc. with a general computer usage focus, so those non-gamers out there should check out other Razer products as well.",A solid choice for gaming,1180915200,18,,

Its widely regarded as one of the best games ever made and with good reason. It was a bold step forward for the Zelda series and its impact is still being felt in the series today. Nintendo has decided to create this sequel in the form of A Link Between Worlds for the 3Ds and it measures up well to its predecessor. The visuals are amazing and whether you are playing on the 3DS where you can see amazing 3D effects in this game, or the 2DS which doesnt have the 3D but  is still an amazing system  (affordable and comfortable and won't have hinges that break) you will get an amazing experience. The overhead view calls back to A Link To The Past but also creates its own style. So to with the music, which calls back to A Link To The Past but also creates its own thing and is awesome for it.  The new game mechanics are fun and there are amazing new things you can do. The ability to become a painting on a wall to move around in new ways is innovative and changes the gameplay immensely.
But there is something more that must be said. A Link Between Worlds does something that so many have wanted.  It brings back a nonlinear approach to the series. You are given the option to rent items ( or later buy the items) instead of finding them in dungeons ( which can still be done) but there is also a risk.  If you die while holding rented items then you lose them which can create problems if in a dungeon but that just adds to the challenge.
And challenge is a good word to say because this is a game that does not hold your hand, there is a hint system but it is optional and the game is better for it.  There is also a hero mode available that drastically ups the difficulty of the game and its very much worth trying out
There is a detailed story in the game I don't want to spoil here which involves a villain named Yuga and Hyrules twin world Lorule, which Link must  journey between ( hence the title). There are cut scenes in the game that are well done and the story is great.
This game is a huge step forward for the series but there are also cameos and shoutouts to past games like Majoras mask ( you might see a familiar location reappear)

The objective of the game, for those of you who may not be familiar with the series, is to take your katamari and roll up objects around an environment, in an attempt to make your katamari as big as the goal. You can only roll up objects that are smaller than your current katamari size, so it's similar to the snowball effect.

Now I know this sounds boring and simple, and in theory it is, but something about this game is so compelling that you want to play so much more of it. The control scheme is simple, you can play through the entire game with just your joysticks. They've added in other features, such as jumping and what have you, but we're just going to disregard that, because it doesn't play too much of a role. But yes, two joysticks is how you move through each level, sucking up as much stuff as you can.

There is lots of stuff to collect, as each item picked up is added into your library. Perfectionists like myself will have a good time getting all the items, finding all the cousins, collecting the presents, and making the biggest stars. So while the gameplay itself is simple, there is some depth.

I have yet to figure out what the storyline of the videos have to do with anything that's going on in the game. It's so insanely random it blows even my mind. I do enjoy the eccentric humor though, and find myself chuckling at the way things unfold. The actual story of the game (and why you're rolling katamari) is pretty straightforward.

The one thing that blows this game above the rest of the games is the OST. Katamari Damacy has always had really great music, but this soundtrack is full of remixes that just make your ears sing. I can't get enough of it, and I wish that Namco would release an OST with all their games like Atlus has been doing.

Overall, if you've never played the series, I reccomend at least giving the demo a wholehearted shot. Fans of the series will want to certainly get this game for the sake of having yet another amazing game in their collection.

However, I did try to play it despite my general inability to play horror games. The graphics are absolutely amazing, my C2Q 9450 @ 3.01 GHZ w/ 8 gigs RAM and 9800GTX+ were able to run it all settings high or ultra high with no anti aliasing @ 1680x1050 with no visible lag. I didn't get an FPS count.

I did not get around the first corner. I was playing with a xonar D2X hooked up to Z-5500s, the ambience was overwhelming. I suck at horror games as it is. The tight, narrow corner was just too much, I knew the game would, by its introduction, contain much melee combat with the monsters mentioned in the manual - which were on par with the puppets in thief 3 - deadly shadows even in black & white.

My rating is: If you have a good system, good sound system, big monitor, and play these types of games, it's going to blow you away like an arctic storm. If you dislike horror games, this is one where things will jump out at you (admitted by the manual's monster descriptions). These things will be scary in a psychological type of way. You should stay away if you don't like horror games, or like them a little and have a good setup.

Rated 4 stars for fun, the engine looks like a blast to play in. The level design creates a sad, oppressive atmosphere. The sound hammers it in - that you are not in a good place. One star off for being overly intimidating. When you start the game it's 'on', unlike the only game that has a level I can compare the environment to, thief 3 deadly shadows in shalebridge cradle, which is built up to in the game.

Overall rated 5 stars for the following reasons:
-No DRM what-so-ever in the U.S. versions, finally making some headway.
(But DRM in the european versions! Write the company, take no prisoners on this issue!)
-a ton of work went into this game for gameplay, not just graphics.
-Creature design is innovative.
-Made it to a ""T"" rating instead of ""M"". They created an oppressive, scary atmosphere without ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, or rotting corpses.
-PC only. No compromises for a console with 10 megs of video RAM and 512 megs of system RAM.

I've tried but just can't get into them as much as a good story-driven experience.

Having not played uncharted 1-3 and only played a bit of Uncharted on PS Vita, I didn't know exactly what to expect from this game. I'm very glad I took the chance as it's been one of the best games I've played since The Last of Us and Tomb Raider reboot (the first one, not the 2nd).

I'll try to cover most parts of the experience but feel free to comment if you have any questions.

The disc takes up about 50GB of HDD Space after installing and downloading patches.

The game starts off by throwing you right into the action. Just like The Last of Us, you're put right out there into the game without a tutorial mode and you really don't need one. The game starts off great and continues through the end. You're constantly moving from location to location, on the hunt for something new and having new stuff thrown at you. I had a great time and went through the game in about a week (compared to most games I rarely finish). Having not played Uncharted 1-3 I still had a great time and was able to tell who the characters were -- I'm sure that fans of the series will have a better connection, but it's not required.

The game is absolutely beautiful. You'll see what looks like a cutscene showing an enormous city, characters walking around, mountain/oceans and  more in the distance.. only to realize it's all realtime and all playable.

Throughout the game you'll have a few puzzles thrown at you. I found most of these to be pretty straight-forward which was nice.

I'll be honest and say I didn't spend too much time looking around for treasure, talking to people or just checking out the areas. I pretty much went straight-through the game and spent about 12 hours on the campaign mode. If you did want to stop and look around everywhere, I could see it easily taking 15+ to complete.

The story has you hooked from the start and you want to keep going to complete the game. The gameplay itself does get a little repetitive in that you're usually using the same few methods of progressing, but I never got tired of it like I did in some other games (Rise of the Tomb Raider).

Overall, I had a blast. I've not only finished it but also started a new game to play through again. Highly recommended for PS4 owners.

GOOD:
- Play over Xbox-Live (and has downloadable content)
- Really balanced gameplay
- Graphics look great (Doom 3/Half Life 2 quality)
- Use two handguns at once (action movie style)
- Make or edited your own multiple player matches, and even play them online
- Considered an instant Classic to many Video Gamers today
- A.I. is challenging but not overpowering
- Total upgrade over the original, which was considered a classic by many

BAD:
- ""To be continued ending"" did not play well with the fans
- Sometimes gameplay can get a little repetitive
- Lack of real variety in enemies
- Liner level design
- Gameplay wise not too much has changed since the original

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- Sci-Fi military FPS where you fight off an alien race who wants you dead, similar to Starship Troopers, Aliens (Alien 2).
- Play as an enemy trooper in some levels
- Only get to carry 2 weapons at a time (but if using two handguns, three at a time)
- Drive vehicles, such as tanks jeeps and alien spacecraft
- Online play over Xbox-Live also system link and spilt screen available
- Co-op play (only on system link or spilt screen)

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Halo
- Doom 3
- Area 51
- Star Wars: Republic Commandos

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- There is also a Special edition of this game, which comes with some behind the scenes stuff
- Note when you play online you never really get to pick and choose who you (or your team) versus in the matches, the Xbox dose almost all the setting up, some like this others hate it.",Combat re-evolved... you decide,1126483200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It works GREAT!  I don't understand why so many ppl are having problems.  Maybe I just got it the day the patch came out or something.

Gameplay is good (as far as PC RPG's go not compared to PnP fo course)  Character interaction and that stuff gets a 5 star rating from me for a PC RPG although I would have liked the ""D&D Hardcore rules"" difficulty level to include the pain in the rear of getting a character raised when killed instead of the cheassy MMO style you get back up at the end of the fight with no penelty.

The majority of negative things I have read about NHL 2002 can be turned off in the form of a menu option.  The skill levels are appropriate, you will easily move past beginner once you learn the basics and only the experienced player should attempt the All-Star level.  I'm happy on Pro most of the time.  You can create seasons, playoffs, or Olympic tournaments using either NHL or International hockey teams.  You can also save a roster file to keep up with the latest trades going on in the NHL and always have the latest, most accurate team rosters.  Perhaps the best addition to the EA Sports NHL game as of late is the emotion meter.  Win a fight or follow-through on some big hits, your emotion meter goes up and you may find it easier to score goals.  Great addition as this is the case in real life hockey games.  I've read mixed reviews on the color commentary and while some of it is cheesy, I find most of it very hilarious and entertaining.  ""I have a message for a spy in our audience... do not trust the smiling penguin, I repeat, do not trust the smiling penguin.  Good luck Mr. Spy.""
If you do decide to pick it up or already play NHL 2002, here is a cool trick I discovered.  If you start holding the shoot button to get your shot meter up and then click either the right or left trigger button at the same time (just holding trigger makes you spin), you put a shot right on net regardless of where you are on the ice.  I've had shots from behind MY blue line sail past the goalie.  This is also a great trick to use when they pull their goalie at the end of the game and you want to score with a specific person.  The shot never misses.  I scored 66 goals, most empty netters, with Scott Parker, the enforcer for the Colorado Avs, in my season using this trick.",Awesome game!

5.0,False,"07 19, 2010",AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B003O6JJKY,Michigoon,"First off, there is basically no functional difference whatsoever between the regular console an Xbox360 250GB- I'll refer to it as Xbox360S from now on- S for Small. The only area of incompatibility is that I think* the new console doesn't fit older hard drives. This is a non-issue, as the new console comes with the largest drive available, so if you have a current drive you'll be porting your information over using a transfer kit**. So really, it's just a question of where the new console is better than the old one.

Pros:
-Largest hard drive available means more storage space for games, movies, and more.
-Quieter parts mean a better experience. The 360 is easily the loudest console this generation while it has all the fans and disc drive running. The 360S is much quieter, bringing it in line with or even quieter than some PS3 models. I never had a problem with the sound in the first place, but I won't deny the improvement.
-Decreased power consumption means this new console will put some money back in your wallet.
-Has the HDMI port in back, if you're still stuck with a first-run 360 that doesn't have that.
-Cool black finish, which I feel is superior to the iPod-pearl color of the old console.
-Lighter, smaller design makes it easier to place in your entertainment center.
-Although it'll take some time in the field to get real data, the new hardware seems to have a better build and new cool-down features to all but eliminate the old ""red ring of death"" problem. This looks to be the most reliable 360 hardware yet.
-And to top it all off, the price is very competitive.

Cons:
-The case looks sort of like a gaming computer, with the new grills on the side. I'm not a fan of ""Xtreme"" gaming computer design, so I'm not sold on this look.
-These case features also favor a stand-up orientation for the console. Keeping a console vertical can lead to accidentally jarring or knocking over the unit, which can cause damage to the spinning disc inside or the console itself. Keep your console horizontal, even if the design looks a bit odd that way.
-The glossy finish, while it looks awesome, attracts dust and fingerprints like crazy. You have to handle the console with surgical clean-room care, or else a few invisible fingerprints will show up dust-encrusted in no time.

In other words, I feel that the internals of the console are wholly improved while the case design is a draw. If you're considering getting a new or a first 360, this is absolutely the way to go. There's a rumor floating around that there may be an Arcade version of this console released later this year for budget-minded consumers, so if budget is a concern, I'd suggest waiting too see how that option turns out.

If you already own a 360, ahould you upgrade? Well, it depends. The functionality is basically the same across all consoles, so long as you have a hard drive. If you're on an older Arcade console without a hard drive, or if you're frustrated by your older console's small hard drive, this new hardware is a pretty awesome upgrade. If you own the Elite model with the 120GB hard drive, or any older console with a 250GB drive, all you're really getting is quieter fans and a few bucks off your electricity bill.

*I'm not 100% how the new console does or doesn't support older hard drives, I'll re-post once I find confirmation.

I had missed out on Chrono Trigger back when it was originally released in the 90s and I always felt as if I was doing myself an injustice by not having played it.

Many fans of the game warned me that the PlayStation 1 port of Chrono Trigger was inferior due to load times. Many advised that I would best play the version released for the Nintendo DS as, apparently, the Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger features all the cutscenes of the PlayStation version with none of the load times.

Due to my lack of a Nintendo handheld, I held off for a long time from playing the game. I asked around on forums if the load times of the PlayStation version were really as bad as people say, and most people seemed to feel like the load times were game breaking.

Allow me to ensure you that the load times of the PlayStation 1 version of Chrono Trigger hardly leave a damper on, what I would consider, a masterpiece. If you only have a PlayStation console do not let your doubts stop you from experiencing Chrono Trigger.

In my own personal situation, I chose to download the ""PS One Classics"" version of Chrono Trigger from the PlayStation Network because it plays on both the PS3 and the PlayStation Vita. Up until now, I've been playing the game on the Vita as Chrono Trigger is the perfect game for a handheld console.

The Story
Without spoiling the game for anyone who has yet to experience Chrono Trigger, I can tell you that Square has given you, what amounts to, hours of enjoyment and replayability. Chrono Trigger features a diverse amount of characters and environments and is fully engaging throughout. Never did I feel as if the game was tedious or as if the game was a grind.

The Presentation
The visuals of the game look immaculate on the Vita's OLED. The fact that the game is in 2D makes the visuals look hardly aged and the Vita's bilinear filtering seems to enhance the jaggedness of the sprites even more so.

The game sounds great and has, arguably, the greatest soundtrack of any video game out there. The Vita, however, does not have a powerful external speaker -- the game's music is best enjoyed through your favorite pair of headphones.

Controlling the game was a joy with the Vita. The controls of the game are fully customizable, as are all PS One classics played on the Vita, but Chrono Trigger is one game where you will want to use the incredible D-Pad provided by the Vita.

Overall, Chrono Trigger is an excellent buy for the PlayStation Vita. The game is not only one of the world's greatest RPGs, but it is also the perfect title for a handheld. Though Chrono Trigger might be old, it surely is one of the greats. I am eagerly awaiting the game's sequel, Chrono Cross, which is also available on the PlayStation Network.","Though Chrono Trigger Might Be Old, It Surely Is One of the Greats",1393372800,,,

5.0,True,"10 22, 2013",A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B00GGUT7E8,Sky,"Well I finally got around to playing Bioshock Infinite. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-War-Ascension/dp/B007TYC8MI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of War Ascension</a>&nbsp;it was a release date purchase for me, but I just never got around to it until recently. So I'll try to keep this late review as brief as possible.

If you like shooters or action games...Bioshock Infinite is for you. For chronology's sake I'd highly recommend that you play the first two games before you play this one. But chronology is completely unnecessary for Bioshock Infinite. Here's the good news: You get the original Bioshock free on the same disk (with the PS3 version)! So at least play that if you haven't already.

I loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BioShock/dp/B009WI7VAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BioShock</a>; I became immediately immersed in it and spent well over 20 hours completing it during my first playthrough because there was so much to explore in the game. Bioshock Infinite is no different. While the game progresses in a linear fashion, it's a huge open world that is yours to explore and backtrack on with a few optional objectives or just to gather supplies.

The scenery is immense and every town has more detail than the eye can capture. The structures within the towns are perfect and the rooms within the structures are as realistic and...well...just so detailed. I can't even fathom the amount of time and effort that went into putting this game together.

The visuals alone in this game make it worth the price of purchase. And seeing everything in the game can be rewarding. Exploration is usually fruitful, because hidden throughout the expansive game are all kinds of weapons, perks and information about where you've suddenly found yourself captive. And this time it's not under the sea.

The game begins very similarly to Bioshock. You're out on the open sea approaching a structure that seems to pop out of nowhere. But this time instead of entering a doorway to a city beneath the sea, you're propelled into the stratosphere to a city in the clouds called Columbia. And there you find roadblocks o'plenty to prevent you from easily reaching your goals. While there is certainly some familiarity with the game mechanics, the Bioshock Infinite creators have givens fans a remarkably unique Bioshock-esque experience. The main difference between Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite is that while the original was dark and very creepy at times, this third in the series is mostly bright and more action oriented.

So is there anything bad about Bioshock Infinite? Not much. If I to find a flaw it might be that it's all auto-save; you can't just quit and restart the game wherever you left off. You need to make sure that you see it auto-saving, and if you're an explorer like me you could be in an area for a long time without realizing that you haven't auto-saved in some time. So be aware of that.

There's no question here...add this to your cart. This is a 5-star game...whether you've played the first already or not. At the time of this review, Bioshock Infinite is under 30 bucks on Amazon, and that's a great price considering you get Bioshock 1 with it as a bonus.

This game changed my perspective on RE games, but what a game could be. This game is SO HARD. It's one of those games where you say, ""I've been playing this for 2 hours, why not try for another 2."" I'm not too far in the game yet, but the enemies are not normal. They are so smart. Let's put it this way:If the enemies in this game had guns, you'd be !@#$ed!!!! You die SO FRIGGIN' FAST. That's what makes it fun to play. It's set aside from any other game i've played. One reason why: In any other game, when someone kills you with a chainsaw, a little blood flies, you go into a slow motion fall, and it plays sad music. NOT THIS GAME. I was standing there reloading my Shotgun, when a large man with a chainsaw was coming at me. As I pulled up to fire, he quickly put his chainsaw against my neck. My first thoughts were, ""greate, now I get to see the bad graphics of the game."" Yeah, I was wrong. To make a long story short: When my guy hit the ground, he hit it without a head on his shoulders.

The combat while somewhat confusing at 1st is simple yet very fun. It seems to mix Gears of Wars with Japanese RPG elements.

The Graphics are amazing. Hard to believe the Wii could do that but then you see the bad framerate during cut scenes and gameplay and it reminds you of the limited power of the Wii. While annoying at times I personally appreciate the effort put into the graphics and for them pushing the little white system to it's limits. Some scenes are breath taking.

Music is beautiful and appropriate with some catchy tunes.

What really gets you hooked though is the Characters and story. The characters while nothing special are fun and charming and the story simple enough and to the point that it doesn't get in it's own way or you are bored with tons and tons of background story and exposition like other RPG's. The voice acting is great and the accents add to the charm.

The hours fly by with this game and I like the main romance in the game.

This game needed a more polish for it to truly be elite. The aiming needed the Wii pointer and the frame rate is far from stable and there are rough edges but even then the game is entertaining and a great experience. Highly recommended.",An amazing unique game on the Wii,1347321600,,,
5.0,True,"05 27, 2002",A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00005MO5E,Christopher Kennison,"Before reading this review, realize that I've not owned a system in ten years.  Playstation's consideration to those that bought the old system was what drove me to finally purchase one.
That being said, Madden 2002 was my first game and when I put it in, my jaw hit the floor!  The graphics are mind-blowing.  The games can be played in numerous styles of camera movements, all of which edit and fade like a real television crew would do.
The game play is very realistic.  Other reviews have said how the passing, running and pass rush stuff is hard... and well, it is.  Yet, that's what makes it realistic.  You have to practice at it.  Unlike previous games, you can't just throw passes into double coverage on a regular basis.  You have to use pump-fakes, burn passes out of bounds, or hopefully you got Culpepper, Stewart or Vick and you can tuck and run.
Just a little advice... play-calling on offense and defense... is everything.
The game is awesome.  The graphics are incredible.  Even during play-calling the game never stops... it continues to show the huddle.  Quarterback talking to receivers and backs about the previous play.  Even showing the coach get [upset] about a dropped pass or a false start.
The best part about the game though, graphics and realism aside, is the fact that you can redraft the entire league, create your own team and jerseys, sign players for contracts and enter franchise mode and build your team over numerous years.  Watch players retire and draft new ones.
Finally, the down side.  I've played it for awhile, and their aren't many.  But, the announcing of Madden and Sommerall gets repetitious.  Fortunately, you can turn it down and just listen to crowd noise and F/X.
The other downside I've found is that you can't watch games that you're not involved in.  Which kinda stinks.  I'd at least like to watch the Superbowl if I don't make it that far.

Despite its expensive price (yes, copies on Amazon run usually from $38+) if you enjoy sniping this is a game for you. The second you pick it up you start to practice, and PATIENCE is the key to the game. Your skills will improve by about the third or so level, so if you want to restart your game to get back to those early enemies who gave you hell because you knew nothing about sniping when you first started, you might as well. The graphics are pretty good, although a bit choppy at times, I have nothing to complain about, the enemies' AI is awesome, they'll actually go after you if you sit for too long in a spot, so you have to be constantly moving. The controller takes a bit to get used to, and the sniping techniques a bit more so, or maybe this happened to me because I started on Sniper Elite difficulty right away. I repeat...patience is the key to this game, you will die a lot, yes, A LOT, of times, so why is this game so good? There's nothing better than lining up a perfect shot, executing it and watch the bullet cam follow your shot as it hits your enemy right in the face...I've shot people in the mouth, that's how realistic it gets, or maybe getting a two for one, or three for one shot might be better, or how about blowing up a tank with a shot and watch people catch on fire and run for their lives?

The graphics and effects (especially the Physx) are quite impressive.  It's neat to see fog part when you walk, papers fly in front of you, and Batman's cape is almost another character in-and-of itself.  I know some people have had issues with the game but it has run flawlessly for me so far.  I haven't had any crashes and barely any framerate lags at max settings.

If there is any negatives to this game, in my opinion, it can only be that it takes a monster of a machine to run it at max settings without the experience being ruined.

5.0,False,"11 7, 2012",A35VJC424AGADX,B0050SYX8W,MikeB,"When it was announce that Bungie was leaving the Halo franchise in the hands of newcomer 343, some were worried about Halo's future. I, for one, wasn't really that hyped for Halo 4, and wasn't awaiting it's release with any real anticipation. Now that it's out, however, I've had a chance to get my hands on the game, and I can honestly say it's an amazing first effort from 343, and one of the best games of 2012.

GAMEPLAY
In my mind (and I hope the minds of many Halo fans) what makes Halo so great is the solid gameplay. When I think of Halo, I think of precise, responsive controls. It's been this way since Halo 1, and Halo 4 is no exception. The first thing I noticed about Halo 4 was that it ""felt"" like a Halo game. Movement, jumping, aiming, shooting and driving all feel perfect.
Like previous Halo games, Halo 4's campaign has a good amount of variety to keep the shooting from getting stale. The weapons, enemies, and armor abilities all keep the game interesting, and just when it feels like the shooting is about to get monotonous, the game will throw a driving section to change it up.
The Covenant return for Halo 4, and they act just like in previous games. Their presence keeps Halo 4 ""feeling"" like a Halo game, but to keep it from feeling old, Halo 4 also introduces a new enemy, the Prometheans. They act different than the Covenant, and will require you to change your battlefield tactics. They are a very welcome addition and prevent Halo 4 from feeling like a rehash of the same old game.

GRAPHICS
Halo 4 looks great. Some have said it's the best looking Xbox 360 game yet, but I don't know if I'd agree with that. I will say it is the best looking Halo game yet, and certainly stands among the top tier of 360 games. Geometry is higher than ever, textures looks crisp (with some super rare exceptions), and the lighting is better than ever. They've added lens flare and bloom lighting (which I'm sure some gamers will complain about) and a whole bunch of new effect that make the game look more real than ever. The animation (especially for faces) is also more detailed than ever and is really impressive.
The look of the game has been tweaked somewhat. The UNSC ships and uniforms have been redesigned and look a little less military and a little more sci-fi. The Covenant troops and ships have been redesigned as well, and it's a bit odd at first. It doesn't hurt the game in any way, but for those long time fans (such as myself) who are used to the look of previous Halo games, it takes some getting used to. The new Promethean enemies and architecture look great and are very well designed, and fit well into the Halo universe. Overall, I like the aesthetic changes to Halo 4, as it helps the new game (and the new studio) distinguish itself.

SOUND
The music for Halo 4 is a big departure from the previous games. It's great music, but it's quite different. The music is still orchestral, but the Halo theme music we've all grown to love is absent. The new music works well with the new game, but so far it hasn't been memorable like the soundtrack for Halo 3.
Sound effects have also been completely re-done. The new sound effects are great, they have a very full sound to them and every weapon and blast sounds devastating. Enemies sound ferocious and intimidating, and vehicles sound powerful. Although everything sounds different, it still sounds appropriate and works well in the new game.

STORY
Halo 4's campaign has a good story. Some have hailed it as the best Halo story yet, but I wouldn't agree with that. The story (like the previous games) often feels like Cortana telling you to go here and there, and you follow waypoints until another cutscene plays. Most cutscenes consist of characters telling you they're under attack and then you have to go kill things. Toward the end more important story points are revealed, but for the majority of the game it's pretty basic. It's not bad, just nothing really complex or intriguing.

MULTIPLAYER
Halo 4 has changed multiplayer in several ways, most notably the new perks system. You can tell it was inspired by Call of Duty, but fortunately it doesn't feel out of place. The thing that makes Halo different from CoD is the pacing. CoD is frantic and chaotic, but Halo has a tactical feel. What weapons you choose and what armor abilities you use are will have a big impact on how you play, and taking into account your shields and your enemies' shields is key. I'm not a huge fan of multiplayer (in Halo or any game), but I've played enough of it to know that Halo 4 does not feel like CoD as some reviewers on here have claimed. Halo 4's multiplayer still feels like a Halo game through and through.

CLOSING
Halo 4 has changed in a lot of ways. The enemies are different, the aesthetics have been re-designed, and the music has a different vibe. But Halo 4 keep intact the areas that matter most: The gameplay and the feel. As a longtime fan of Halo who was getting burnt out on Halo games after Reach, I am impressed with the way 343 has breathed new life into the franchise. And most importantly, the whole time I was playing I was having a great time.",Incredible effort from 343,1352246400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The story was much darker than any other dmc game and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I love the limbo aspects and the way the world changes, showing the underworld laying just below what humans can see.  It was much more ""magical"" I guess you could say, maybe even paranormal. Alot of limbo reminded me of the film ""they live"" with its advertisement signs changing to command to consume and submit, etc. The whole raptor news was clearly a stab at Fox news and their programming, which is actually brainwashing. Dante is viewed as a terrorist and yet we know he is doing the right thing, the truth is in the events that are unseen to the world outside the supernatural. This story would make a great transition to film in my opinion.
The combat is stylish as can be, it looks great and I don't understand what anyone can complain about.

Having become intimately acquainted with the eshop demo, as well as putting it quite a few hours into the main game by now, I feel confident in my ability to give an informative, honest assessment.

The story in Bravely Default features four protagonists, all of which have backstories that any veteran of the genre would regard as painfully cliche at first glance. You get Tiz Arrior, a young man recently beset by horrible tragedy and great loss. He is joined by Anges Oblige, a sheltered priestess girl who must save the world by healing huge crystals through prayer, Ringabel, an amnesiac ladies man with a magical book, and finally Edea Lee, a spy for an enemy nation who joins the heroes at a later point (try to guess why she does this. Here's a hint, it's cliche, lol). Of course, political intrigue, giant elemental crystals, and world saving shenanigans ensue. It almost sounds like a ""Four protagonists walk into a JRPG"" bar joke, doesn't it? Thankfully, what Bravely Default's story lacks in innovation, it more than makes up for in execution. The writing in this game is, for the most part, very well done. The story is mostly coherent and moves along at a good pace with memorable events that make sense. The characters are all generally likable and developed well. Plenty of endearing humor offers a nice counterweight to the serious moments. There's a nice balance between freedom and structure, so you never feel strangled by linearity or lost with no guidance. Overall, Bravely Default is a very charming, well-written JRPG adventure. All of this is more than I can say for any&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-from-the-last-several-years/dp/B000FQ2DTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy from the last several years</a>&nbsp;(sadly), so Bravely Default gets a big thumbs up from me in its plot and story structure. It's very enjoyable to take in. It's a definite throwback to the classics of yesteryear and makes for a good adventure.

To aid in the sense of adventure of the story are the visuals, all of which are influenced by hand drawn art, water color paintings, and old-timey children's fairy tale books. It's very unique, full of imagination, and quite beautiful. The visual designs of the settings in this game are nothing short of brilliant. Wondering around the various locales, all of which are quite unique, really reminded me of how I felt playing Final Fantasy IX for the first time. Amazing. The 3-D effect does even more to add dynamic impact to the visuals too. It's no stretch to say the awesome settings add a lot to the game's story. Akihiko Yoshida, known for his work designing characters in games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vagrant-Story/dp/B00004SPW9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vagrant Story</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-Tactics/dp/B000SSPH3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, and the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-DS-remakes/dp/B003O8EDUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy DS remakes</a>, did the character designs in this game. To be honest, this aspect will probably be a love-or-hate thing for people. His stylized art tends to be. While some characters are kind of silly looking and clumsy (more on that later), I personally like the character design for the most part. All-in-all, Bravely Default is an undeniably gorgeous 3DS game.

Let's talk about sound for a moment, and specifically the soundtrack. Let me put it this way... If you told me that the soundtrack in this game was some long-lost collaboration between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yasunori-Mitsuda/dp/B0009J8HB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yasunori Mitsuda</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nobuo-Uematsu/dp/B00025E1TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nobuo Uematsu</a>&nbsp;from the 90's, I'd probably believe you. Seriously, Bravely Default's soundtrack is amazing. It has the striking emotive melodies characteristic of Mitsuda's music, and the lovely sophistication and elegant refinement of Uetmatsu's work. Every song fits its purpose perfectly for every situation/scenario/circumstance. Indeed, ""Revo"" nailed the soundtrack in this game. Other than that, most of the sound effects in the game are appropriately nostalgic. There's a surprisingly large amount of voice acting in the game, and thankfully most of the time it falls between acceptable and exceptional (keywords there being ""most of the time"").

As a JRPG, Bravely Default works very well mechanically. All of the basics in the game are very well refined and play as well as any classic Final Fantasy game would. However, there are a couple twists in place that make this more than just an adequate FF clone. For one, the battle system features an ""action point"" system wherein each action, be it attack, use an item, etc. costs you 1 ""Brave Point."" In ""Brave Mode,"" you can go all out up to a deficit of 3 BP, meaning you can attack an enemy four times in a single turn if you want. Beware though, because if still standing, the enemies get to wail on you for four turns in a row.  Then there's ""Default Mode,"" which is basically a turtle-up move that allows you to accumulate BP for later use, while greatly increasing your defense for that turn's duration. This system has a fantastic feeling of risk vs. reward that encourages and prizes smart strategy, and I appreciate that.

The other unique aspect in this game is its robust job system. Anyone who has played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-V/dp/B00002R28C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy V</a>&nbsp;will know what I'm talking about. Each distinct ""job"" or class has different stats and abilities and most (but not all) fall under archetypal roles (ie. White/Black/Red/Time Mage, Monk, Thief, Ninja, Knight, Swordmaster, etc), and you can change any character's class on the fly under most circumstances. There's a huge number of team combos you can achieve with this that not only allows for deeper strategy, but guarantees that every player can have a unique experience catered to their tastes. It's really great fun. Usually, I find bare-bones turn-based RPGs to grow rather boring shortly. Thankfully, the job system and Bravely Default combat modes makes this a very engaging RPG. Throw in unique streetpass features and an incredibly large amount of options that makes the game experience tailored to virtually any player, and you get a cocktail of smart design choices. All of this makes Bravely Default a unique, deeply refined JRPG that makes the experience stand out among its source inspirations.

For the sake of being fair and all that, let's talk about some criticisms for the game. Like I said earlier, the character style will be a love-hate thing. Since the job system changes character outfits, the only constant distinguishing feature of the main characters is their face and their hair. Unfortunately, two of the main characters, Ringabel and Edea, have hair styles that look stupidly ridiculous, even for an anime character, which is a shame. Again, I usually really enjoy Yoshida's work, and it's *mostly* great here, but some designs fall short. Also, some ""job"" outfits look ludicrous in certain cutscenes. Try imagining a serious scene playing out while Ringabel is wearing the Las Vegas Elvis suit (complete with aviator shades) that the Performer job has, or the fox-mask wearing Ranger... You can't do it without laughing. Kind of ruins the serious vibe in those scenes. The pre-rendered cutscenes, while having stunning detail, feature characters with a bizarre, somewhat unappealing combination of chibi and realistic proportions and details that I'm not a huge fan of. It's a little off-putting if you ask me. The mechanics of the game are awesome except for one admittedly small thing that still really sticks in my craw. There's a special sleep ability you can use to make battles much easier. You replenish your supply by putting the 3DS is sleep mode for eight hours (pain), OR, pay REAL money in a micro-transaction. Now, to be fair, the game is balanced so you don't *need* it, but still... Call me old fashioned, but if I pay this much for a game, I expect every feature to be included, no strings attached. Micro-transactions in a game like this is just plain ugly in my opinion, and glaringly so in a game meant to salute past classics.  You stay classy Square Enix. This sort of stuff is why people these days call you an evil/incompetent out-of-touch corporation. None of these issues are ""game breakers"" per se, some are admittedly very nit picky (except for the microtransaction aspect), but they are worth mentioning for the sake of fairness.

Bravely Default is, by and large, a great 3DS game, despite some nit-picks here and there. If I could be more specific, I'd rate this game somewhere between an 8.5-9 out of 10. In many ways, this game is a wonderful salute to the kinds of JRPGs Square made for the PS1 back in the day. In fact, I'd say that Bravely Default is to PS1 JRPG masterpieces what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Radiant-Historia/dp/B004CVWETI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Radiant Historia</a>&nbsp;is to SNES JRPG masterpieces: a nostalgic homage while still offering enough new ideas to feel like a genuinely unique and fresh JRPG for the modern age. All things considered, I'd highly recommend Bravely Default to the majority of RPG fan/3DS owners who, like me, miss the kind of quality JRPG releases of yesteryear. Buy it, gather up your trusty four protagonists, and prepare to save yet another world in a new (but not final, sequel already confirmed) fantasy.",A refreshing JRPG experience that evokes nostalgia for the Squaresoft of yesteryear,1391817600,72,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'}",

That game was WayForward's Sigma Star Saga. Little did I know this wasn't your typical RPG. You know, the kind with turn-based battles and whatnot(i.e., Golden Sun, Breath of Fire, Final Fantasy). This game mixes together an RPG with an R-Type style space shooter. Sigma Star Saga is an adventure that tells the tale of two warring factions and the human that tries to bridge that gap between them. The story, itself, is rather entertaining, engaging, and humorous at times. As far as the game is concerned; it's full of exploring, solving puzzles, advancing the storyline, picking up items and blasting through levels of enemies. I commend WayForward & Namco for taking a risk and trying something new with the RPG genre.

For the most part, Sigma Star Saga's gameplay works. While I'll go on record as saying it's a good RPG worth spending some time on; I will warn you that, at times, the battles get pretty monotonous and repetitive. When you'd like to do more exploring instead of battling, you can't because the game practically forces you to see the battle through to the end. That is my biggest gripe with the game. Course, I'm making leeway into the meat of story now(Patience is the key, I guess) but it is rather annoying at times.

Looking past that, Sigma Star Saga is a lengthy RPG with a very entertaining story. While it's no Final Fantasy or Golden Sun, it's still an original concept that should be commended. If you're into RPGs but are looking for a little something new and fresh, then Sigma Star Saga is right for you. While this particular type of game really isn't my cup of tea, as I'm into more traditonal style turn-based RPGs & Strategy RPGs, it is entertaining enough to me to see it through.",Sigma Star Saga.....,1136764800,5,,

This is definitely not a game for people who like shooters.  It's a game of stealth and planning.  It's one of the best horror survival games I've ever played. It is truly a game where you have to depend on your own skill and ability to survive.  The game basics are that you are playing as Ripley's daughter and it is now 15 years since the original Alien movie.  A flight data recorder from the Nostromo has been found and is being kept on a space station called Sevastopol.  You are invited to be a part of the team to recover the information. Of course, upon reaching Sevastopol, it is apparent that something has devastated the station, leaving only a few desperate people alive and in hiding.  The station itself is barely functioning with power being out in most places and systems malfunctioning everywhere.  The survivors are almost all hostile as in they will kill you if you're seen.  There are also synthetics called Working Joes who have become psychotic killers as well.  They are also creepy as heck with glowing eyes and they chase you around saying things like, ""You shouldn't be here"" and ""Please calm down"" in a soft monotone while they try chase you and try to beat you to death. Add to this wonderful mix, a large, fast moving Alien creature and you can see how this could be a tough game to survive.
You start out with nothing, not even a flashlight, and must collect scrap and other supplies to craft the tools you need such as medkits.  You can also find things like flares, and some weapons along the way. You will get one of the motion detectors like they had in the movie which is very useful. I started out playing on Medium difficulty and had to switch to Easy the first time through.  Learning how to stay out of the way of the Alien, the synthetics and the other humans took a while.
The game autosaves only after the end of each chapter.  Otherwise you can only do hard saves at certain stations and it feels like a major victory to just find a save station when you are in the midst of a cat and mouse survival game with the creature.  The first time you encounter the Alien is truly frightening.  I was hiding under a desk and it descended from a ceiling vent.  All you can see is its legs and the long, long black skeletal tail and you hear the clicking of its feet and it walks around looking for you.  Moving too fast or making unnecessary noise alert it to your presence.  There are usually plenty of hiding spots but if you stay in one place too long, it finds you anyway.  One of the tips that comes on screen is ""Hiding in only ever a temporary solution.""  So, you're hiding under a desk or in a locker and you are terrified of being caught but you know if you don't move soon, you're going to be found.  And, did I say, there's no way to fight this thing.  If it finds you, you're dead, instantly dead. At least that's how it happens in the first part of the game.
This is a game that is going to take some time.  I played for well over twelve hours total before completing it.  It's that difficult even on the easy setting.
For anyone who loved the Alien movie franchise or if you really enjoy horror survival games, this is the one to get.  It's so much better than the other new release Evil Within.  This is finally a game that I feel was worth the ""new release"" price.  It does earn every bit of the M rating.

I put 23 hours on it and still play it....got the PS Vita version on the cheap too so I'd have it on both systems.  I prefer this one, even though it looks better and controls better on the PS vita.  I like this one better because the bottom screen is your map (and of course there's just one screen on vita) and has convenient touch control on screen so you can easily deal with camera angles---almost as nice as second stick.
This game sounds incredible with a real orchestra...I looked it up online after hearing how great it sounds.  Put those headphones on and crank it up.

Plenty of quests are on the game without any dlc....and are replayable.  The game does mark ones that have been completed.  This version offers two ----yes two save slots!

Custom Words are collected phrases that are equipped and changeable that do effect abilities in battle. Example--Program Chopper with the custom words and he yells, ""I'm a doctor!"" while healing you in battle, the phrase itself also ups his healing power. This can add hours of depth alone and keeps you fom hearing the same phrases all the time because it also changes the phrases your character yells in battles.  All spoken dialogue is in Japanese....and there is a TON of voice work even in battles
but don't worry....you get subtitles that don't intrude.  Run around---town and npc speak...tap your R button when it flashes on the screen and you
 respond appropriately...little things like that make for a very enjoyable time.  Battles also have timed actions as well as button combos.  You'll love some of the moves you pull off!  Easy, medium and hard are difficulty choices you can change during the game as well.

So it initially contains a sort of mini game in between levels that is simmilar to Expeditions; which is the other game on here. Expeditions is something very simmilar to Jewel Quest that I'm sure most of you have heard of. Those 2 games alone I give full scores to.

I can't really think of any downsides to the game, everything works fine, it's fun, it has plenty of hours of levels to keep you playing. I guess the only thing I could say i'd give the thumbs down to is the company logo/ads when you turn the game on, although, there is plenty of worse ones, as these only last abut 10 seconds maybe, so it's not too bad.

So why buy JQ Solitaire, JQ Expedition or JQ Majong separately when you can get all three in 1 in this value for your buck game!",Great collection of games.,1265155200,,,

It wasn't a state of the art shooter that introduced new things we've never seen before. The weapons were all pretty standard fare ignoring a few. Why then was it such a huge hit? The atmosphere. BioShock introduced us to a new world, one that exists completely under the sea where all of the top minds in the world escaped society to a hidden retreat to do their work unimpeded upon by governments, religion, and regulation. This land of the free goes by the name of Rapture and is run by a man named Andrew Ryan. What could go wrong in a city that sounds so right? Well, if you played the first game, everything. The city erupted into civil war, but not until scientists created something called ""plasmids."" Plasmids are a sort of tonic you inject into your body that changes your DNA to give you super powers. They come from sea slugs and eventually make you go nuts if you take too many, which everyone does. Without ruining the first game if you haven't played it, it seemed like it was pretty final. Leave it to 2K Marin to prove us wrong.

The sequel BioShock, named BioShock 2, takes place in the same city as the first game, Rapture. The game opens with you as a big daddy. You end up having your little sister stolen from you by a big sister. Sophia Lamb, a psychologist in Rapture, starts giving you orders and within a few short moments, you are dead. Push forward 10 years and you're magically back alive. The reason for you being alive is explained in the game so I won't give anything away, but you're now back in Rapture. Sophia Lamb is aware that you are alive and doesn't know why, but wants you dead. She has become some sort of religious leader for Rapture. As a Big Daddy, it's your job to find your little sister, who just so happens to be Lamb's daughter Eleanor. Your journey will take you from where you woke up, to an amusement park warning of the dangers of the surface, to an infirmary, night club, theater, and many new places in Rapture. As a Big Daddy, you will be doing what the Big Daddies did in the first game...guarding little sisters. As you encounter other Bid Daddies throughout the city, you can kill them and adopt their little sister. She will join you willingly and you can either return her to a vent and rescue her, harvest her and kill her (nets more ADAM- the currency for buying special powers), or put her to work collecting ADAM from ""Angels"" (corpses). This is a trade off though as you could piss of a Big Sister by doing so. More on that in a little...

That's as much of the story I can tell you without ruining some pretty good surprises. The thing that made BioShock 1 so great was the ambiance/atmosphere of the game. While this game has the same sort of feeling, it's almost like a been there done that feeling. It's not bad by any means, but it's not as new and exciting as it was the first time we all played it. You're still going to be picking up audio tapes, reading scribblings on the wall, and hearing maniacal musings of the city's residents resounding through your speakers. It's all well done and carefully tunes to present a linear, but solid story on what happened to Rapture after Ryan lost control.

The enemies from the first game are back with some new ones thrown in for some good measure. You have all sorts of splicers ranging from the common foot soldiers, to spider splicers, lead head, houdini, and big daddies. The new forces, a brute who likes to charge, alpha big daddies, a Big Daddy with a rocket launcher, and the Big Sisters, are all welcome changes. Speaking about the Big Sisters for a minute, they are awesome. BioShock devs said that they wanted to create an enemy you would fear. I can't tell you enough how successful they were. The Big Sisters are not regular forces you encounter throughout the game, instead they are triggered. Whenever you find a little sister, you are given the choices I mentioned above. When you rescue or harvest the little sister, there is a chance a Big Sister will come after you. When she does, you hear a loud scream followed by a warning on the screen that says ""The Big Sister is coming for you, get ready."" That's when the panic sets in as you put down traps and try to get in a good area to remain covered. When she shows up though, it's on. It's very common to find yourself completely out of ammo and health packs by the time the battle is over...and this is on normal difficulty. Can't imagine it on hard. They are a great addition I would love to see more on in part 3 (although it might be difficult with the story).

Something else that's new in this installment is a morality system. It's nothing as major as Mass Effect, but it does dictate how your game is going to end. Everything from killing certain characters in the game after learning about their dark secrets to sparing little sisters will have lasting consequences. It won't make itself known until the end of the game though, besides some extra commentary during. It's a neat addition that at the very least warrants an extra playthrough to see how it would end otherwise.

The gameplay is similiar in BioShock 2 but also profoundly different/better. In the previous game, you were a mere human without a dive suit. Guns took two hands and as a result, you couldn't duel wield weapons and plasmids. Yeah, those days are long gone. Welcome to the world of zapping someone with electricity while putting 2 slugs up their ass. It's a great feeling to use plasmids and weapons together and feels very natural. It doesn't take much time to get used to either. The plasmids this time around are varied as well, but not as varied as I would have liked. It seemed that most of the major plasmids are back with not many new additions. This can be overlooked though since you can upgrade those existing plasmids to do cooler things. For instance, one of my favorite plasmids is the swarm of bee's. Level 1 shoots them out onto people. Level 2 does more damage. But level 3 adds a whole layer of complexity to it. When the bee's finish killing someone, they will hide in their corpse as a sort of trap. When someone walks by, they hop out and attack. This is key to many Big Sister battles and it remains one of my favorite plasmids by far!

The graphics in BioShock 2 are similar to that of the first game with some minor tweaks here and there. It's a beautiful game, but so was the first one. The environments are going to have you taking closer looks to see how life really was in Rapture. All in all, it's a beautiful game.

The game lasted me about 8-10 hours. That's pretty standard for an FPS. You could probably milk an extra couple hours out of that if you aim to find all of the recordings and power to the people stations (for achievements). After you finish the game, you have another option besides playing through it again. BioShock 2 introduces multiplayer into the mix. The multiplayer component of the game isn't anything extraordinary, so if you were looking for a MW2 killer, look elsewhere. What it does do, is offer a unique multiplayer experience that will give you some fun times with your friends.

You begin the multiplayer by picking a character. You can pick one of 5-6 different characters, each with a story. After you pick your character, you are taken to your room. In your room you can walk around, interact with things, listen to sound bytes that unlock with levels, change your appearance (masks mainly), and change your loadout. Your loadout can be 2 weapons, 2 plasmids, and 3 gene tonic slots (think perks in MW2). When you're finished, you can enter a game. Most of the crowd are playing the little sister games where you have to find and capture a little sister or hold on to the little sister for the longest to win, but deathmatch type games exist. The multiplayer is fun because it's something different. Using plasmids to set people on fire and then shoot them is pretty cool in a big setting. You won't be playing it 6 mos. from now, but it could be good for a little while. There are some online achievements for multiplayer so if achievements are your thing, you'll need to rank up pretty high to 1K this game.

So, is BioShock a good game? Yes, it is. Is it a great game? Yeah, I'd put it up there on the greats list along with the first one. Will it win game of the year or sell unlike any other game? I doubt it. It's a great game, but it's not the legendary game a lot of people were hoping for. The main reason for this is because we've been here before. It's not really the developers fault since there wasn't much they could do. Once the decision was made to revisit Rapture, their fate was sealed. Rapture is still a great city to shoot up, but at this point, the shiny new car feeling is gone. Being a Big Daddy and protecting little sisters is cool and everything, but we've seen this being done before. This is a small complaint though as the game as a whole is amazing, this is just one thing standing in it's path of even more greatness, if that makes sense.

So, should you go out and buy this game? I say yes. If you own a 360, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. Even if you haven't played the first, there is a lot of enjoyment to be found in the second. You may not get some of the references to the first game, but it does a pretty good job explaining things. Some references, like when Lamb refers to the ""WYK Experiments"" would be lost on people who didn't play the first game (WYK = Would You Kindly) but these are few and far between. The multiplayer is a neat distraction that may provide hours upon hours of enjoyment for some, but only a minor distraction for others. It's good, but nothing revolutionary. After completing the game, I'm excited about the possibility of a third BioShock. While the original developers who made BioShock 1 were not the team behind BioShock 2, 2K Marin did a good job in their place. No matter who handles the third, I'm sure we'll have a great game regardless.","BioShock 2 Review - The Return to Rapture is Similar, But Better",1265932800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I love Lightning so much; she is my favorite FF character of all time. That being said, FF13 is not the best Final Fantasy series out there, but it is the game that gave me Lightning and Hope, so it's definitely in my top 5 Final Fantasies.

Lightning Returns is super fun and the battle system is amazingly fast paced and engaging. I thought it would irritate me that the only way to level is by helping people but after I thought about it, it actually makes a lot of sense. I mean, COME ON! She's the friggin Savior, her entire GOAL is to help people and save their souls.

I really respect that the director went a non-traditional route with this game and it shows in almost every aspect. LR is so unlike other Final Fantasy games that it stands out uniquely on it's own. For reference, I played all three games in the series and I'm really happy with this one! I didn't like 13-2 at all, so everything that LR does is an improvement for me! Also, the game has a level of difficulty that I've only truly seen in FF Tactics. If you have no patience or a bad temper, I would recommend playing on Easy. Otherwise, you'll be using LOTS of curse words, haha.

Also, the social aspect was kind of bizarre in the demo, but I'm actually enjoying it immensely. I didn't think I would, but its cool to share my battle scores and screenshots with my friends on Facebook.

But in this particular case - component cable for the original xbox, the other options are pretty bad. 10 years after the original xbox was released and 5 after it was discontinued, the only other options that are really out there are cut rate chinese knock offs.  I bought one of those before I got this and it was DOA out of the box - I don't know how you screw up CABLING, but it was done.

Anyway, this cable is built to withstand a war. It's super thick, rock solid, and jacketed in what looks like kevlar. While none of this will make a difference in your signal, you own't need to worry about it not lasting. Of course the tips are gold plated so corrosion won't be a factor either.

As an added bonus, it looks like this guy has a little 1/8th inch output jack at the base of the input plug so you can plug in a set of computer speakers or some alternative audio source, which is a nice touch.

And lastly, if you DO go component on your xbox, please remember to enable the widescreen and 480p, 720p, and 1080p resolutions in the OS under the settings->display. While I haven't seen any games that use 720 or 1080, 480p widescreen seems to be fully supported, which puts the xbox on par with the wii at least (hah!).

Wow, was I missing out!

I always used to love RPGs growing up as a kid -- Final Fantasy 7 was my favorite game ever growing up -- and that always steered me away from the Pokemon franchise, weirdly enough. I both was suspicious of Pokemon ever being able to have a worthwhile story, as well as feared the constant grind of most RPGs.

Well, I was pretty much wrong. I say pretty much because Pokemon's story is actually oddly appealing -- you're playing a character who's out to Catch 'Em All. So, no, it doesn't have much of a real 'story' per say, but it's all just goofy fun, so where I was wrong was in thinking it needed to be something it isn't and shouldn't be.

What I was really, really wrong about was the fear of grinding. The ""catching them all"" part of the game has made grinding fun again! It's not constant battles everywhere, even where you don't want them, to get pointless levels. You're the one seeking out the battles -- and not for pointless levels, but to find the new Pokemon. The world keeps things fresh, so you never find yourself lingering in the same place too long, and there's oodles and oodles of goofy side games to keep yourself occupied when you feel you need a break from catching your Pokemon... and would rather spend time 'getting to know them.'

I've talked about how much goofy fun there is in this game, but it does take very seriously the heart of this game, what makes it all work: it's mechanics. The combat system is a deceptively deep turn-based combat system. There's tons of strategy involved and, for someone who enjoys meta as much as I do, a whole bunch of tough choices to make. That said, it would be hard to get those decisions so wrong that you'd ruin a Pokemon -- but even if you did, for whatever reason, all you'd have to do is catch more.... or even breed them.

To put all of this in perspective, I went from being a deep skeptic of this entire franchise a month ago, who decided to buy the game as an experiment, to a full-throttled Pokemon addict who's put 20+ hours on this game... when I thought the days of me having the patience to play games for hours and hours was long since at an end.

Street Fighter 5 is an investment in the next 6 years.

Capcom is taking a brand new approach to their flagship fighting game franchise.

In the past, before online updates were the industry norm, Capcom would release a Street Fighter game.  Then after a year or so, they would release an update to that game.  Then later on another update.  This would be very costly to the consumer over time.

This time, Capcom has learned from 3 decades of experience, and they've decided to sell SF5 as a ""service"".  For the price of one single disc, they offer the foundation.upon which they will build for 4, 5, 6, even 7 years (as they did with SF4 before).

True, the game starts out fairly sparse on launch (this is in part because of the Capcom Pro Tour tournament series that begins on February 26th.  Capcom had to release the game early enough for players to prepare for the year long $500,000 competition, which is open to anyone to enterincluding YOU).

But, as with every SF game, Capcom has plans to add more characters, more modes, more content.  The difference THIS time is that all these post launch, gameplay-related upgrades will be FREE.  Forever.  No Super SF5.  No Ultra SF5.  No Revelator disc.  No SF5 Kombat Packs.  No additional purchase required.

Every single DLC character (there are already 6 planned...more to come next year) can all be earned by playing the game and accumulating in game currency.  No real money is needed.  All extra single player modes will be free.  Additional tutorials, trials, and challenge modes will all be added in March for free.  The large cinematic story mode that they have in the works for June will be free.

If you're familiar with SF4, you should know that it was supported with new content for SEVEN YEARS.  SF5 will be no different.  Except this time, you won't have to pay for Super, Ultra, Omega versions.

Regular SF5 is all you need.  The rest will come to you, as long as you simply play the game.

It's a question of short term gain vs long term gain.

In the short term, the launch product may seem limited.  But, over time, the value of this one disc will become more and more apparentuntil one day, after years and years of added updates that will cost you ZERO dollars, you'll 'get' it.  You'll understand why the ""limited"" launch really didn't matter much in the long run.

And, If you don't want to jump in on launch floor, that's fine.  Feel free to wait until the content you're looking for is added before picking up SF5.  Rest assured it will eventually be there.  For free.

2. The buttons are pressure sensative which really makes a difference in games like Gran Turismo when you are pressing either the brake or the accelerator. The more you press on the button the more gas or brake your car recieves.
3. The analog control sticks are spot on and make for tight controlled turns in both Gran Turismo and SSX. I love the analog sticks for that simple reason. I find the control pad isn't precise enough for those games and will ofter oversteer.
4. The design is flawless it fits perfectly in your hands. Some of the other controllers are too big and hence awkward to hold in your hand and play games with.

5.0,False,"11 26, 2006",A23HCR977WY1YN,B000BC38LA,Adam,"Character Setup:

 You can become one of several races all with different attributes and special talents. Each race is better at certain skills than others, such as marksmanship or hand to hand. Be an archer, mage, warrior and much more. If you do not like your particular ability tree, you can customize your own. You can also customize your characters looks. You can make it look like you if you wish. The only downside is that it can take a good deal of time just to make a character look half decent.

Gameplay:

 In Oblivion, you are thrown right into the action as you sit in a prison cell(for no known reason) and suddenly confronted by the king and his body guards. From here the adventure begins. The Country side is perhaps the most beautiful you will see in a game. Each town is quite different than the other. Some towns are in the warm climate on level terrain and some are on snowy mountain tops and harder to navigate. Depending on what your character setup is, you can choose to join the theives guild, fighters guild or mages guild. It is quite obivious from the start of the game that you should partake in as many side-quests as possible. Not only to bring your skills up, but because it adds a whole new level of gameplay than if you were to just do the main quest. The biggest issue I had with the game was with the dungeons, keeps, caves and oblivion gates. They are all pretty generic in layout. It can get tiring (especially the oblivion gates) doing something you feel like you just did. Aside from that, interaction with characters in the cities, in your guild, and throughout the country makes the game all the more interesting. You'll run into highway men demanding money, theives and all sorts of ghostly and or monster like beings. Many, many hours of gameplay.

Graphics:

 Now this is perhaps one of the most demanding games on your computer. I did not have the greatest computer when I first got this game. When I built  my new computer, I was blown away by how much I was missing. With a fast processor, plenty of memory and a good video card, you will be able to run this game more towards the high end graphics wise. Unfortunately for those who have an older computer, you will not be able to see the game in all its glory.

Story:

 The story is pretty straight forward. I will not delve into it at all, but it is compelling enough to keep you playing.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and will continue to. There are so many things to do and places to go that this game could very well be the last game you get for a while. Kudos to Bathesda for making an excellent game.","Fun, Entertaining Game",1164499200,5,,

Roller Coaster Tycoon is definitely  one of the best sims out there (and there are many other theme park sims to  choose from).
The interface takes a short time to get familiar with, but  is very simple and easy to operate.  The graphics are great (could you use  this program to design a real rollercoaster?  Looks like it to me!), the  levels each have different goals and features.  I especially appreciated  all the different theme landscaping available, including Greek and Roman  architecture, Wonderland theming (giant chess pieces, candy, mushrooms,  etc), and Wild West props.  The rollercoasters are a blast to build, but  not simple to master.  After 20+ rollercoasters, I have yet to build the  perfect ride.
My only problem was with the 3/4 view -- at some points  it's hard to see what's going on with your rollercoaster as it interacts  with other rides and the landscaping.  This problem was easy to solve, as  the view options allow you to ""turn off"" the rollercoaster  supports, landscaping, paths, or anything else that gets in your line of  sight.
